warrick; 11; what you got ah the plot thickens i smell these dirty diapers over here probably used to clean that diaper pail baby was killed before it even left the house guy tried to cover his tracks
sara; 12; what do you mean have n't checked for prints it's a ransom letter you got anything for me i could have told you that what where a drum goes around three times to print one page so if the andersons printer was used no vertical dots
grissom; 13; yeah well we need to look for what's out of place grissom you're breaking up are you standing next to the copy machine outside ballistics no i want you to move away from that machine look check all the printers at steveanderson's company get q.d to help you with a warrant target all immediate coworkers and disgruntled employees first
sara; 13; ransom note's not from the anderson printer or paper supply the andersons are clear whoever wrote the letter did it from a different location and brought with them you want me to check ballistics are those our dogs grissom
warrick; 13; yeah this mold i made of that shoe print matches the gardener's boot found in shed over there and a gardener's boot in garden is not out of place well the andersons did say guy's been out of town on vacation for last three days

paula_francis; 17; the andersons who own a profitable internet company in lasvegas are said to be devastated by death of little zachary as for leads the police will only say they have widened investigation to include employees of steveanderson's company immediate coworkers are being asked to give dna samples by all accounts the employees are complying voluntarily
dr._albertrobbins; 18; i ca n't give you exact time of death but do know cause was asphyxiation the retinal hemorrhages are result of intercranial pressure from an edema the edema was caused by an acute lack of oxygen no positional asphyxiation maybe abductor might've tried to protect him from the cold suffocated him by mistake i'm going to run tests on a microscopic fiber found in his throat but i do n't think his death was benign gil or accidental sternum was cracked x rays say the fracture is fresh manhandled and suffocated this little guy did n't have a chance
grissom; 18; he was smothered smothered how did you find hand marks trauma around the mouth or nose he was in a blanket when i found him wrapped pretty tight
grissom; 19; are those from anderson's company you got homicide's list of disgruntled employees
sara; 19; yeah there's like 200 of them in that place i'm going to test them against the ransom note one by not yet
grissom; 20; you call homicide back and tell them to get us that list now hey where are we on those dna samples yeah so answer my question
warrick; 20; hey i got the hair samples from baby's crib ready for comparison well dna's jammed sanders says he'll get to the blood comparisons
grissom; 21; i hear you're backlogged these
warrick; 21; as soon
grissom; 22; there now they're off your counter zacharyanderson dob 01-23-01 date of death three hours ago until we find out how and why this is the only case you work on
catherine; 24; mr and mrs anderson are calling they want to know why you refuse release the body for burial they said that you gave the coroner strict instructions sure
grissom; 24; what everyone did n't find that baby i did and that little boy is dead because someone lost their temper or screwed up god knows what so excuse me but this victim is special you better drive
sara; 24; grissom you told me a few weeks ago that nothing is personal no victim should be special everyone follows your lead
catherine; 25; we need to refer him as the case unfolds a stranger would n't treat victim like that a wealthy family
grissom; 25; i'm very sorry but we have to preserve the evidence in a case like this and as difficult this sounds zachary is evidence your child was found five hundred yards from back door in clean clothes wrapped a white blanket laid carefully under statuary the fbi tells us that you never received a call from abductor what kind of a kidnapper forgets to call the family but you have nothing to hide
gwenanderson; 25; well do you have any leads any idea who did this
steveanderson; 25; you think we had something to do with this my lawyer warned me that you were going to try this you do n't have a suspect so now're going to come after us
grissom; 26; the blood we found in baby's room it belongs to your son tyler
warrick; 26; i thought'd deliver this in person dna came back on the entire family
brass; 27; we contacted the association the story checks out i also did a background search tyler has quite a temper on him do n't you ty you were expelled from school twice last year for physical altercation your brother zack say something you did n't like were going to let him get away with either
catherine; 27; beat up a 12-year-old in the school stairwell
grissom; 27; and you wiped up the blood with some type of pine cleanser let's go back a second tyler you said that baby-sat for robbie and zack last night right that still does n't mean you did kill him
gwenanderson; 27; i had uh i had made dinner and then steve walked up to the clubhouse we were gone maybe 30 minutes until 09:00 he's uh upset he is not usually like this
steveanderson; 27; we had a homeowner's association vote meeting it was just five doors up from our house that was schoolyard stuff sit down now
tyleranderson; 27; i was playing ball in the backyard and cracked zacky's window dad had told me not to hit the ball towards house so i went up and replaced the window before anyone got home cut my finger on glass i thought got it all i told the police that this morning what he made fun of my mother i was n't going to let him get away with that do n't talk about my brother that way you bastard people are calling us killers and i miss my little brother
catherine; 28; so what are we looking for well let's start up and work our way down
grissom; 28; i do n't know
grissom; 29; good nick did you find any ethanol on the lip of that bottle call me when you get the results see if they can find out what this green substance is on these nylons i found in mr anderson's closet
nick; 29; here's the father bottle of cola unknown i duplicated conditions and monitored the pressure that escaped from father's bottle which he told you had been open two hours against one know was kept this log pressure released every quarter hour well i've got trace running tests now but did an unscientific whiff test picked up a hint of some kind booze i'll take a swatch get it back to you asap
grissom; 30; the mother's prints father and a set of unknowns and who is needrafenway
sara; 30; they're not unknown i ran them against the employees of steveanderson's computer company disgruntled and otherwise they belong to a needrafenway steve's secretary so of course i checked out her printer as i'm sure you know all printers have their own unique signature these three tiny vertical dots from needra's printer match the ransom note perfectly
brass; 31; maybe you can explain why your printer was used to create the ransom note found in anderson home from the anderson home sure quickest way to end a guy's marriage
catherine; 31; you two were having an affair because his wife got pregnant what a new baby screw up the office romance yeah well a lot of women would understand if you went over there and got rid that baby
grissom; 31; thank you for coming in we have evidence that this came from your printer we also found a strand of hair our lab has matched it to you do you go upstairs cause that's where we found this particular hair are these your nylons i found these hidden in the back of mr anderson's closet so did you come to him after disposed of the baby and ask hide them for
needrafenway; 31; thank you anything i can do to help you know it's just terrible what happened what there are 500 people who work in that office anyone could have used my printer i'm steven's secretary i go there we ended it i'm not going down this road it was more than just an office romance okay much more okay i need a lawyer is that it is that what you're saying here talk to steve
brass; 32; geez
catherine; 32; steve asked her to get out from underneath the obligation of a newborn
brass; 33; have n't these people ever heard of divorce
grissom; 33; how do you explain her hair in the baby's crib you've lied to me before you told me that opened cola bottle the morning reported zack missing we had a test done you opened that bottle six hours before said did the night somewhere around 11:00 p.m the lab is still testing it i also believe that you cut it with alcohol was needrafenway in your house that night
steveanderson; 33; needra did n't kill zack any more than i we broke up the day that i learned gwen was pregnant with zack i love needra but my family more needra asked if she could see zack after he was born to help her kind of accept the reality so i had her in last saturday to watch him sleep gwen had the kids at skating needra was out of the house in 15 minutes you do n't believe me about what
steveanderson; 34; what are you doing
gwenanderson; 35; what have you done
steveanderson; 35; that's not how it happened
gwenanderson; 36; robbie what did you do
grissom; 39; did you catch her suffocating your son well why do n't you tell me how it happened
gwenanderson; 39; all right i heard you
lasvegas_post_reporter_(woman); 39; mr anderson i'm from the lasvegas post how do you feel about these pictures your secretary sold to the midnight informer this afternoon the tabloid's web site needra sold them to pay for her legal fees mr anderson excuse me i'm from the lasvegas post can i ask you a few questions
nick; 39; never seen him like this before
paula_francis; 39; one of them is quoted as saying anything to help mr and mrs anderson in their time grief
sara; 39; they're still working on it
steveanderson; 39; you're damn right we do n't do we have to this conversation right now what yeah where did you get these my only comment is that i love wife very much
brass; 40; that's because this mother is the bad guy cnn just dug up a 13-year-old charge against gwenanderson i heard it on the car radio it's called shaken baby syndrome the oldest boy tyler when he was a newborn she shook him so hard they had to go the hospital she shook the kid unconscious yeah they were on the phone with arresting officer from oregon he faxed me this report our grieving mother her record for child abuse
catherine; 40; a wife kills her baby to get back at husband over his affair come on any woman would go after the husband not baby well i do n't buy it i just do n't buy it doctor she really loved that baby a guy cheats but the wife commits murder how come moms always end up the bad guy with you freud types is this authentic
grissom; 40; what kind of charge
grissom; 41; let me tell you something people are presumed innocent until a court of law can examine all the evidence and prove otherwise until then everything else is gossip
catherine; 42; ice just do it that was quite a speech you made out there but between me and the water fountain think gwenanderson's innocent i still am i'm just taking your temperature
grissom; 42; i do n't need this what are you changing teams now you've been her biggest supporter
brass; 43; hey we're up
catherine; 43; you did n't answer my question
grissom; 43; you're right
bradlewis; 44; change your tone or i'll end this right now she was a new mother 23 years old if she'd meant to harm her son why would call 911 no that's why the police were called in and by time my client went home found chewed food on kitchen floor it was all too late she was branded as for the death of little zachary my client categorically denies any involvement she's a victim of an intruder who entered her home and abducted killed child thank you all for your continued efforts to find the real killer what's your point she belongs to the club grass stains if you arrest her now have 48 hours to charge you really want to show your hand at the arraignment
brass; 44; all on his own well it's a legitimate question but i have to work on my tone you're right i'll try again all on his own we uh have a receipt that links them to your client we'll be in touch
catherine; 44; go ahead mrs anderson but she does n't play golf remember our conversation mrs anderson it's not your game
grissom; 44; you shook him unconscious did the e.r find proof that there was food lodged in tyler's throat did you know that your golf course paints its grass it's actually a vegetable dye biodegradable they've been using green dye on television tournaments for several years i found a pair of nylons in the back your husband's closet the exact same dye from golf course where zachary was laid to rest is on your nylons
gwenanderson; 44; i never meant to hurt tyler you have to understand he was choking he had gotten food in his windpipe his face was turning red steve was at work so i patted him on his back and-and and stomach and finally i turned him upside down started shaking to get the food out dislodge it did but i realized that had hurt him so called 911 it was a french fry he'd grabbed it from my plate excuse me
steveanderson; 44; look robbieanderson mommy i want my
catherine; 45; did you see that she did n't seem like that type to me
grissom; 45; a mother repelled by her young
gwenanderson; 45; can we just go please tyleranderson what's going on
steveanderson; 45; all right okay
catherine; 46; i'll catch you later i want to hear that 911 tape
catherine; 47; hey
grissom; 47; did he nail time of death from the baby's clothes
sara; 47; grissom the coroner's been trying to reach you 09:00 p.m but uh there's something else he isolated the fiber found in zacharyanderson's throat it's a flame-retardant material generic name metaramid fire-retardant infant's clothes are made out of vinyon the fiber found in zack's throat is a stronger chemical treatment it's found in things that are made to be near fire and flames hey can i go with you same color as the fiber in zack's throat
catherine; 48; mrs anderson was n't there yeah well it's a legitimate comment does n't make her guilty of anything are you familiar with the jonbenet case well the police went back and they found an earlier call that was placed from home to 911 audio tests separated out son's voice now i'm not saying that tyler's our guy but we need to check into every avenue in the parents name but did you look under tyler s i mean a rich kid like that's probably got cell phone
gwenanderson; 48; what are we going to do oh god what are we going to do
steveanderson; 48; our baby has been kidnapped 493 fairmark please hurry
warrick; 48; okay this is the 911 call from anderson house at 04:30 a.m you would n't think so but i went ahead and separated out any underlying voices she was standing like two meters from the phone i know so checked to see if she was like faking her concern this program measures the stress level of speakers the stress is real a little well i did backtrack and there were no other calls that night from the anderson house land line or cell phone yeah all right i'll get into it
catherine; 49; hello 07:00 a.m i'll be there yeah i'll bring it all
grissom; 49; anderson's attorney seven a.m bring all the evidence
bradlewis; 50; my colleagues messrs landry and frank are representing steve tyleranderson respectively although we're not co-counsel in the strictest sense've agreed authorities should have no more than three questions to put our clients each after that we'll accept written submissions only this may prove cover-up none of it proves they killed zachary estimated it could be 08:30 do n't give them anything please mrs anderson for the record my client made this statement against legal counsel
catherine; 50; nice what money can buy all right let's work backwards starting with the cover-up sometime around 11:00 p.m the night of kidnapping you and mr anderson had a drink rum cola and decided what to do with the body of zachary we have yet to determine whether or not his death was accidental intentional mrs anderson while your husband was writing the ransom note you wrapped zachary's body in a blanket that got from upstairs linen closet you then laid his body to rest near a statue on the golf course you put down a plastic bag from the pantry so that he'd remain dry evidence of genuine care and concern and mr anderson you put up a ladder outside the window you had to wait till morning report him missing
grissom; 50; i do n't have any questions we know what happened in your house the night zachary died we've interpreted the evidence the question documents lab thinks that a parent wrote ransom note because there's no money amount too hard to put a price on your own son that's how you got the grass stains on your nylons the only shoe prints we found were yours and gardener's has been out of town you then drove over to your office and cranked off a ransom note on the first available printer possibly thinking that if you used a printer from outside your house we would n't be able to trace it but these three dots have given you away you're right counselor zachary's life was taken much earlier in the evening the coroner estimated time of death at 09:00 p.m yes while robbie and zachary were in tyler's care you said that we could ask three questions each am i right would you tell us how killed him we're going to have them both arrested
gwenanderson; 50; stop ty did n't do this and i ca n't go on i killed him i came home tyler h-h-had n't put zachary to bed because he was crying and i wanted hush him up just i went too far i smothered him with a pot holder and that's when steve i came up with the kidnap story so that it would n't look suspicious and you may not believe me but i loved him i loved him very much
steveanderson; 50; my family is done being railroaded by you people so just ask your questions and let's go it was the longest night of our lives
catherine; 51; guilty people do that when you corner them with evidence
grissom; 51; we're done she copped
tyleranderson; 51; what did you do robbie what did you do
warrick; 51; i was just coming to meet you guys i thought you were at the andersons what guys the mother did n't do it listen
brass; 52; why did n't you just tell the truth
grissom; 52; yeah but then you called your girlfriend and that's when you called 911 but you must have dropped the phone to tend zack and i guess somewhere in the chaos you got disconnected soon after that your parents arrived one of you worked on him so hard that cracked his sternum he's three he's clinically unaware of his actions no court would hold him accountable for that mr anderson we wo n't let that happen
gwenanderson; 52; oh my god what happened
steveanderson; 52; we did everything that could we wanted to protect robbie we did n't want him to grow up with the stigma of boy who killed his brother but everybody else would know it would follow him the rest of his life and my wife would rather go to prison than have anybody know what robbie did
tyleranderson; 52; and we got to talking and i was kind of ignoring zack robbie they were being quiet they were behaving i turned around and saw how still he was i ran to him and he was dead what did you do robbie what did you do he was already blue i pushed i tried to breathe air into him but he was gone
catherine; 53; now i know why you did n't want to hold robbie when your husband handed him outside the police department i'm very sorry of course he did n't you're an average family burdened with a tragedy that put under microscope that close nobody can look good
gwenanderson; 53; i always uh i always tell them gentle he did n't mean it i know he did n't mean it you must think that we are awful people all this stuff's come out
grissom; 54; your family's waiting for you you ready
