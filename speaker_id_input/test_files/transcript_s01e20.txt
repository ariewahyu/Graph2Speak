warrick; 3; no i'm having a block party
grissom; 4; two distinct tire treads one wide narrow hey o'riley i would n't book those suspects just yet i think they ran over a corpse
sara; 4; given the extensive bruising from wide tread mark victim was killed by a larger vehicle not that compact
catherine; 7; we want this one right
dr._albertrobbins; 7; printed your hit-and-run afis found a match brianclemonds 22 born in vegas and he's deaf actually yes he was printed as part of a state aid program in 81 to confirm i examined his ear canal normally the malleus is shaped like a hammer long smooth handle connecting to blunt head but brian's knotted both of them birth defect maybe not see the dried blood on his knuckles no associated wounding blood's probably not his when you find the suspect'll nail him with his own body fluid not yet
grissom; 7; you guys get over there keep me in the loop keep the media out of it good luck there's a college for the deaf about mile from where we found him did you send a sample of his blood to dna has his family been notified
nick; 7; we got a call about ten minutes ago shooting at vegas grounds coffee shop eighth and main multiple fatalities
sara; 7; what's up you can tell he's deaf by his fingerprints the vehicle probably a truck or an suv based on width of tire tread takes off later along comes a compact thump runs over his dead body that ended in murder
warrick; 7; so brian takes a walk crosses the street does n't hear car gets creamed you know what that means smackdown the kid was in a fight
catherine; 8; get ready to pull a double

catherine; 11; in the front door shot muscle first then flynn and some poor kid minding his own business the girls were last four dead one is still alive
brass; 12; guy died on the way to hospital
grissom; 12; mrs clemonds my name is gilgrissom i'm with the lasvegas crime lab may i come in for a minute the bell sets off vibrations which reverberate on floorboards so that he knows someone's at door mrs clemonds i'm here about your son brian there's no easy way to say this brian was killed tonight no no it's not no mrs clemonds we think he might have been murdered would you like to talk a family services counselor
mrs._clemonds; 12; yes crime lab okay my son is deaf that bell is connected to the doorbell yes oh god please no no this is my fault when i was pregnant had the german measles and virus took away his hearing it's my fault murdered talking is overrated mr grissom just find out who did this to my boy
catherine; 13; what do you know about flynn any bullets recovered why guess he got off easy i.d just keeps getting better someone notify the husband how far along was she she knew
dr._albertrobbins; 13; it's been a hell of night first the deaf kid now a hit it's going to take a while process all the bodies i always start with the celebrities frankieflynn 38 gunshot wounds to the head and abdomen only one out of the head nine-millimeter 357 i deal with the pin cushions ballistics deals with the pins shooter could have saved himself a lot of trouble if he'd waited month or two invasive colon cancer on his way out hmmm wonder if she even knew was pregnant
brass; 14; yeah nine bullets all the same caliber looks like robson never got a shot off
nick; 14; another nine-millimeter just like our casings
brass; 15; sure
catherine; 15; need help with the measurements
brass; 16; this one
bradkendall; 17; bradkendall i heard it on the news they're saying it was some kind of a hit where are erin and alice did you call their parents erin locked up twice a week 10:00 on the nose she was training alice moving on at the end of month i ca n't believe they're gone
brass; 17; catherinewillows nickstokes from the crime lab they did n't make it
catherine; 17; shooting occurred around closing time is it customary for your employees to close up
nick; 17; once the coroner makes a positive i.d their families will be notified
janegilbert; 18; i'm severely deaf and can communicate fine i'd appreciate it if you look at me when speak to i wear a hearing aid and can read lips you could have asked if i needed an interpreter there are 152 students at my school we live together study eat we're a family and brian is dead the crime did n't happen here it happened out there neither am i but there are more of you right send someone else with more understanding of this school my students how can you solve a crime without understanding the victim
sara; 18; dr gilbert we need your help brianclemonds was murdered anyone have a grudge against him we understand you do n't want a homicide investigation upsetting your students i'm sorry i did n't mean to offend you we'll also need access to his records i'm not accusing anybody of anything
warrick; 18; was he having any difficulties dr gilbert we're just following protocol we need to speak with brian's friends his roommates but we're here now and evidence is time-sensitive
grissom; 19; how'd it go at the college what did you do all right let's go
sara; 19; they're not cooperating what did we do we met with the president asked a few questions like it's our fault we can hear
warrick; 19; hey yeah we did n't have a warrant so she kicked us out she was kind of hostile
grissom; 20; dr gilbert i'm gilgrissom with the crime lab you kicked my people out of your office look your student is dead do n't you want to know who's responsible i do why cause they do n't understand the victim help them understand is that what you think i'm saying a student is dead maybe you feel responsible maybe you're angry but do n't be angry with us we want to help you yes i will i welcome your involvement now may i see brianclemonds file
janegilbert; 20; well i'm kicking you out too your people ca n't solve this crime when a deaf person meets hearing the so much as says i'm normal you're not if i agree to cooperate you will include me in your investigation
grissom; 21; brian filed six complaints against his roommate paularrington and he took it out on brian assaulted him brian requested a new roommate request denied i want to speak paul you do n't need to hear or speak communicate or commit murder
janegilbert; 21; i did nothing wrong paul lost his hearing less than a year ago tumor he has n't adjusted he's angry there were no other available beds he does n't read lips or sign
grissom; 22; no sara you see deafness as a pathology for dr gilbert her deafness is not handicap it's way of life as long you see this us versus them're going to have problems on case
sara; 22; so you going to tell us how learned sign well the president of college is a real whack job you know i think might be siding with her
grissom; 23; this explains what we're doing i need for paul to read it
sara; 24; what was that all about grissom signs he goes out oh i've read about this machine very frankenstein you've used one of these before so you show the suspect slides of crime scene and if he's our guy
warrick; 24; do you know what grissom drinks when he goes out at night exactly who knows anything about that guy hey check that out brain printing they call it a visual polygraph yeah back in 97 grissom and i used one to interview this rapist the guy was mute but his brain waves spoke loud and clear
grissom; 25; good he recollects you he recollects the college he recollects brian this is a shot of the crime scene no recollection no recollection of the crime scene or brian under these conditions
janegilbert; 25; may we go now if you want to find the killer look outside school
catherine; 26; grissom grissom grissom about what it's like to be deaf sara told me that you spoke in sign and now're putting plugs your ears mm-hmm is that why you forgot about the conference
grissom; 26; sorry i was thinking about what it's like to hear i'm on a case
sara; 27; i photo'ed the victim's torso and imaged tread mark scanned it got running through a assistance cd rom not yet cd database 11,033 patterns could take a while what are you doing what lice yeah he was lice adhere to hair follicles i did n't find any stray hairs on him
warrick; 27; those the tire treads from crime scene any hits yeah checking out the dead guy's clothes whoa what are these they look like lice was n't our dead guy clean well he was in a fight right maybe his attacker had lice and they crawled off on sweater got comfy the stray hair blew away
grissom; 28; hey any luck on the tire treads yeah they make your head itch and after head colds the most common medical problem affecting children
sara; 28; computer's still processing but warrick found something pretty interesting
warrick; 28; you know anything about lice
grissom; 30; stay on the tire treads
warrick; 31; yeah
brass; 32; guess who used to sign bradkendall's paychecks six years ago oh yeah
catherine; 32; frankieflynn
bradkendall; 33; sure yeah at the orpheus i was a waiter in the coffee shop he came in all the time once in a while he owned the place he was everywhere i made cash deposits i carry a concealed weapon glock nine millimeter
brass; 33; hey brad thanks for coming in we just got a few more questions so you used to work for frankieflynn sit down did you see him outside the coffee shop we'll need to see the weapon and any spare ammo
catherine; 33; why do n't you tell us about your ccw permit what kind
grissom; 34; you ran a dna profile and something very distinctive popped up what is it greg dots of blue light on a red sea pyoverdin a pigment excreted from pseudomonas aeruginosa which is bacteria occasionally found in the bloodstream
warrick; 34; why what did you do let me guess you ran a dna profile on the blood from dead guy's knuckles and got match you made it out of bed and dressed yourself so what does that give us so the guy's a glow-stick how does that help us track him down
grissom; 35; i saw it it's missing six digits it's useless what do you call a guy with blue-dotted blood lice and keys to ford explorer
sara; 35; we have a lead i found partial serial number on the broken taillight maybe on its own but the tire tread database kicked out a match the tire belongs to a ford explorer a p235-75 manufactured specifically for their suvs only one with the same partial serial number is registered in vegas
warrick; 35; a suspect
grissom; 36; yes the suv's registered to adamwalkey he's 18 years old no prior complaints we're processing it now i promised to keep you informed
janegilbert; 36; you found the car that ran over brian
sara; 37; lice so that's why grissom late
warrick; 37; hmm creepy critters in the driver's seat you just do n't like other women in his life
grissom; 38; we have a suspect
sara; 38; taillights match
warrick; 38; affirmative on the head lice
grissom; 39; well that's why i suggested we meet here i do n't need him to talk i just want his blood it's a licemeister
randy_painter; 39; i'm advising adam to invoke his fifth amendment rights go ahead and ask he wo n't answer well for that you're going to need a warrant this warrant is for blood and a scalp search
sgt._o'riley; 39; no charges have been filed and i n't asked a question
bobbydawson; 40; striations do n't match the gun that killed those five people at coffee house is n't your store manager s the good news is all of nine millimeter bullets fired at scene from same gun you're looking for only one guy indeterminate
catherine; 40; talk to me bobby well what about the breach-face marks on casings hmm
nick; 40; good news bad same caliber different gun
brass; 41; i got a ton of people out interviewing every two-bit stiff that ever had beef against flynn they're all doing the smart thing keeping their mouth shut you know something i do n't
catherine; 41; well looks like you got zip so we have no statements or physical evidence indicating it was a hit on flynn yeah why not yet nick
nick; 41; what we have is five dead bodies smoke and mirrors
catherine; 42; headphones ricochet through and flynn was closest to the door
nick; 42; if it was a hit the guy came to front door took out al and frankie got witnesses bullets will confirm it shooter was standing here when he shot al bamm once in the chest this is flynn one miss one hit through and each victim gets a different color blue beams are isolated the kid with cd player was alone
catherine; 44; me too what if the shooter was here when he shot big al if the shooter walked through front door erinmccarty the employee who was supposed to close up if she was headed towards the parking lot how do you explain this ricochet the ricochet went out into store there's no hole in the door there's no hole in the door cause had to have been open he shot toward the parking lot first and then front of store so who was in the line of fire what if we have it backwards what if the shooting began back here with erin
nick; 44; shooter was positioned between flynn and the front door flynn eats it nah i would have taken out big al bodyguard first ident found both of the bodyguards paws on counter big al would already be dead it does n't make any sense what if he came through the back yeah shot twice in the back while headed for rear exit what like this i love this job assuming erin was running for her life the shooter follows in back room shoots twice he would have been shooting toward parking lot he'd only shoot toward the front if there's somebody yeah and somebody else saw frankieflynn was an innocent bystander wrong place time
grissom; 45; not even lice eggs
sara; 45; maybe he got rid of them since the other night
warrick; 45; adamwalkey does n't have lice
grissom; 46; pseudomonas aeruginosa greg start a dna comparison this gives us enough to hold walkey
warrick; 46; same as the blood we found on brian's knuckle
grissom; 47; dr gilbert can afford her personal bias we ca n't
catherine; 48; twenty-year-old girl living at home she would have taken a test if was five seconds late panic city well it's not immaculate conception if the guy was mr right she would have told her folks
nick; 48; you really think erin knew she was pregnant i mean six weeks yeah brass talked to her parents there was no guy in her life
catherine; 49; maybe mr married you still have the pregnant girl
dr._albertrobbins; 49; back for more mortuary is going to pick her up later this afternoon at six weeks
nick; 49; stall them we want a paternity test
sara; 50; check this out this fabric matches the victim's sweater and the taillight was smashed
warrick; 50; that's the muffler and this is the back of car there's no way this car was moving forward when it ran over brianclemonds body
adamwalkey; 51; i may have hit the guy okay i remember hitting something it was dark i-i just kept driving did n't look back yeah someone was with me mark markrucker
grissom; 51; adam we found lice in the driver's seat of your vehicle but scalp was clean was there anyone else a witness who might support your account
randy_painter; 51; it's okay in that case my client is now prepared to make a statement tell him adam
sgt._o'riley; 51; first degree murder that's how we see it that's some statement
janegilbert; 52; i want to see him is that the coward who killed brian what happened he scare you talk a little funny make a lot of noises screamed or maybe he just looked at you the wrong way you make me sick
grissom; 53; you offered to help with my investigation and now're compromising it who says it was a hit-and-run not murder he has a witness the witness can say whatever he wants the important thing is that adamwalkey was not alone when he killed brian until now i did not know who was with him his witness is our other suspect
janegilbert; 53; you said'd include me you found the killer who will lie for him and now you do
bobbydawson; 54; right gun wrong barrel check this out this is true match the bunter marks etched in by an electrodischarge machine every casing from a given batch of ammo has the same markings on a microscopic level we should find similar characteristics not as airtight matching the barrel
nick; 54; 911 page what's up son of a bitch swapped the gun barrel out could be an incomplete tool mark maybe the guy dropped his gun either way we still do n't have the barrel but we've got kendall's ammo what about bullet batching every casing's got two pieces of information on it manufacturer and caliber so if you compared the casings we collected at crime scene with from bradkendall's gun which would link brad's ammo to the crime even though we ca n't his gun but still enough to build a case
bradkendall; 55; me the father no way i'm married i do n't fool around you got it all wrong i do n't believe this talk to anyone i'm not like that it was a one-time thing i did n't even know she was pregnant
brass; 55; would you like us to explain the mechanics of sex in workplace you had the power happens all the time i've got a court order
catherine; 55; you're the manager erin was the employee maybe we do all make mistakes but just to be sure why n't you give us a sample of your dna and'll onyour way
nick; 55; well catherine's working on a hunch
grissom; 56; i have just one question does your head itch i'm going to just uh rearrange your part a little hmm according to adamwalkey you were with him in his suv the other night and your head lice confirmed statement they also tell me that you were driving now why do n't you tell us what really happened
markrucker; 56; i did n't do anything why would i need a lawyer do i have to answer that yeah i was with him and like he told you we did n't know hit the guy
sgt._o'riley; 56; i read him his rights last chance for a lawyer fire away how do you know what adam told us
adamwalkey; 57; dude what are you doing that song is a classic probably a dog
markrucker; 57; and we were listening to the radio i changed the station adam got pissed it's not a classic it's crap it's always been crap now this is tight wh-what was that
grissom; 58; the evidence says otherwise well there were n't just lice in the suv there were lice on the victim's sweater do you know what lice eat blood i'm pretty sure can prove that the lice on brianclemonds came from your head
markrucker; 58; we just kept driving it's the truth what are you talking about so who cares about lice
adamwalkey; 59; we tell anybody are in trouble
markrucker; 59; we got to call the paramedics
adamwalkey; 60; hey man can you do us a favor hey what's his problem markrucker let's find out hey moron we just want you to buy us some beer markrucker how about we just grab yours huh adamwalkey what do you want markrucker what do you say you going to give it up
grissom; 60; let me tell you what i think happened you and adam saw brian walking out of a liquor store carrying six-pack you're underage maybe you wanted him to front some beer brian does n't respond then you got out of the car you started taunting him
markrucker; 60; but i did n't want to leave him like that adam talked me into it he had a scholarship to duke next year you know he could n't risk it
grissom; 61; and then everything escalated the blood on victim's knuckles led us to adam the average male loses 80 hairs a day a stray hair left behind lice which brings us to you it would have ended there but as you were about to drive away something caught your attention something in your rearview mirror and you took off let me tell you something son fine no more questions just this you want to know why brianclemonds ran away from it was dark you were shouting at him and he did n't understand what saying brianclemonds was deaf he was afraid of you but you were more afraid of him n't
markrucker; 61; i want a lawyer
sgt._o'riley; 61; gil the interrogation is over he's requested counsel
bradkendall; 62; what am i looking at
catherine; 62; a bunter tool makes unique mark they're identical you came here that night to kill erin you came in through the back
nick; 62; microscopic surface analysis this ought to make things more clear casings from your gun are on the right casings collected from the crime scene are on left
bradkendall; 63; we got to talk listen to me
catherine; 64; but alice saw so you shot her you thought that erin had locked up but there was a kid drinking coffee
bradkendall; 66; i did n't mean for it to happen like that i just wanted to talk
brass; 66; bradkendall you're under arrest for the murder of frankieflynn alrobson roy hintonalice neely and erinmccarty
catherine; 66; is that why you brought your gun
nick; 66; six weeks pregnant with your child
grissom; 67; some people are just afraid you're not my mother she lost her hearing when was eight loved to swim i asked her what it was like to be deaf she told me to stick my head under the water she taught me not to make fun of you everyone the same
janegilbert; 67; and that's why they killed brian because he was different you do n't see us as different who taught you to sign tell me about her and use your hands you're a little rusty true
