grissom; 9; they do have a timeless quality i was a ghost here shooter was standing right there and
warrick; 9; kind of weird being in a high school what were you a jock or brain reconstruction guys can give us a more precise angle measurement but i'm thinking five-four maybe three we got ourselves a shorty
davidphillips; 10; i like to put that off till the last possible moment with decomps silver whole i've done a few of these it looks like a pin's medical implant oh and that's a plate in the skull the head's been rolled yeah and by the sound of things he's been dead about two months you were n't here when esd brought this in let's go to the v.i.p room i'll show you what mean
nick; 10; let's see what metal shows up well there's no gun on our dead body what's that there about four inches long what is that well it was n't from lack of trying
sara; 10; would n't it be easier to just unzip the bag and see what kind of shape our vic is in i see a coin looks like half dollar i'd say we're dealing with a man sound
catherine; 11; and was this a first or has the deceased spray-painted his locker before well that's obvious or a young man would n't be dead
juliabarett; 11; that's dennisfram locker look i'm the school counselor do n't know every move these kids make
grissom; 12; is that a polymer sensor proboscis electronic noses run like ten grand if that thing ran out of here and bit the shooter in ass county would not approve a 10,000 purchase order our job is to think warrick machinery should never matter more than our mind try this glass tube air pump fresh out improvise
warrick; 12; cyranose 320 company sent it to me gratis for a week they figure if it helps csi will buy one yeah well what if the shooter chews a certain kind of tobacco or has unique halitosis and e-nose picks up on it i thought it was our job to speak for the victim no matter what took and hell with budgets air pump cost about ten bucks absorption agent
catherine; 13; and miss barrett says that a dennisfram had been bullied by the deceased all year he spray-painted his locker many times always something to do with build skinny shorty that kind of thing oh i'll catch up to you
grissom; 13; can you arrange for us to meet with dennis well then this will be brief you coming
juliabarett; 13; dennis is slight and barry always picks on him for it of course but he would never hurt barry he's a good kid he's totally nonviolent we can call him from my office
catherine; 14; hey i need to talk you it's not about that
dennisfram; 15; five-three and one quarter yeah why no what kind of test what is that
grissom; 15; how tall are you dennis have you washed your hands in the last hour changed your shirt i'd like to do a test on your shirt if may forensic g.s.r when someone fires a weapon gunshot residue plumes back onto their hands and clothing this means that you fired a gun within the last three to six hours the police are going to want talk you
juliabarett; 15; dennis
brass; 16; so you admit fired a gun so the same night that barryschickel was shot and killed you were out taking target practice where's your gun

robbins; 22; barryschickel from the high school dug three of these 44's from his back first one cracked his infraspinous fossa second one entered past the interior angle of scapula punctured a lung and the last one entered just right of anterior sarratus muscle pierced heart this is a special case see the scar this guy was attacked before i'd say in the last six months whatever it was would've killed him if his heart had been there barry's upper body all his internal organs are on the opposite side of typical placement which was good for this guy until his luck ran out six months hand-to-hand combat sounds like something your suspect would do
nick; 23; hey how's liquid man doing you know sara a lot of homeless guys get these army jackets cheap at salvage stores okay ugh i do n't know i ca n't read an address or a phone number about what

juliabarett; 28; have you talked to barry's parents the older kids get less they talk to their parents look he was very popular and a bully so there was probably a dozen kids who wanted to see him dead

brass; 40; i checked out those kids you talked to none of them was even near the school when barryschickel killed the only one who does n't check out is dennisfram
catherine; 40; there's a reason i can put him at the crime scene jim can you call them from the car
catherine; 41; oh well i'll explain on the way okay but you'll miss all the fireworks
grissom; 41; put him there how no i'm going stay here with this close to warrick
brass; 42; that's the timeline of murder mr fram we know every move your son made up until the gun that's why we want to see your collection you're registered as having two dozen weapons
catherine; 42; we've placed him at the murder here's the fingerprint that i recovered from dennis locker these are dennis prints on file at school the missing kids prevention drive there's a match proves a timeline the alkyd particles in victim's spray paint adhere and dry 30 seconds oxidation dennis had to have swiped the paint within seconds of barry putting it on his locker for print take the janitor he keeps timed records of graffiti job security and dennis left paint on the door jamb in bathroom where barry was shot
dennisfram; 42; ow
kelseyfram; 42; denny it's okay come on we'll fix it
mr._fram; 42; i know must sound like the typical parent but my son had nothing to do with death of schickel boy what well his own fingerprints on locker that does n't prove anything well how do you know
grissom; 43; you still got that 10,000 e-nose were using i just want the software
warrick; 43; this does not belong in a guy's bathroom can we prove this i mean there's got to be a thousand different brands of this stuff out oh now you want my tricked-out toy
kelseyfram; 44; come on drink up here you go good just hold this to your face okay i'll be right back he's got a bleeding ulcer from being bullied by barryschickel
catherine; 46; and then someone killed barry how tall are you no reason
kelseyfram; 46; you do n't know how hard it was for him every morning trying to work up the courage just go school i thought my little brother was going to kill himself yeah five-four with heels why
grissom; 47; you grabbed a top note of floral and now we ask the software to break it into ingredients do you recognize any of these some of these perfumes have like 750 ingredients chanteuse yeah the original application for this program was perfume companies you know testing new brands stealing from the competition
warrick; 47; that's all from one perfume we can narrow it down to one brand
catherine; 48; grissom we got a suspect but it's not who you think how did you know
grissom; 48; grissom let me guess dennyfram's sister vapor molecules see if you can get a warrant for her perfume and have brass bring in
brass; 49; let's get back to my first question miss fram where were you the night barryschickel was killed so what your perfume just wafted into the boys room all way from highway 10
catherine; 49; a high-end woman's perfume it's doubtful that any other girl at the school wears what about revenge for her little brother
grissom; 49; we isolated a combination in the restroom where barryschickel was shot it matches your perfume
kelseyfram; 49; i told you was out driving around yes i wear chanteuse what's that got to do with anything my mom used to wear it and after her car accident i started
mr._fram; 49; wait she has no reason to hurt barryschickel i ca n't believe this that bastard schickel dogged my family now he's doing it from the grave come on kelsey you come near us again do it through my lawyer
warrick; 49; well aromas have fingerprints they're like a unique combination of vapor molecules that linger in the air long after source has gone
catherine; 50; wears her dead mother's perfume nice touch yeah well i smell a rat in the fram family
grissom; 50; might be true scent triggers memory more acutely than any of the five senses
det._o'riley; 51; homicide
manager_of_romanini's; 51; back seat then i drove him out of town i left him on the side of road out by red rock no look he was drunk he was rolling all over my backseat so i put him in a bag from my trunk once we got out of town i just tipped him down the hill i figured he'd get out once slept it off the guy always shows up what am i looking at look i was just doing my job
nick; 51; you did n't maybe zip him up in a bag because he was giving trouble anything like that can i see your right hand sir hey treating another human being like garbage is not a job it's a choice
sara; 51; so you did n't hurt him you just put him in your car is that what you're saying these are the handles from bag that he was found in you see these prints here
warrick; 52; paperwork
catherine; 53; dennis well dennis you have n't told us that explicitly saw kelsey shoot the victim
dennisfram; 53; i need to talk you you have to understand anything my sister did was protect me i forgot a book needed for homework and i knew barry had been there i was n't looking for him i had to go the bathroom my dad's freaking out my sister wo n't come out of her room i figure if you can get the police to make some kind of deal for her she was in a stall i could n't see her
grissom; 53; you said that went back to the high school night after target practice
brass; 54; can i uh talk to you for a minute he copping to anything i do n't think so kelsey was otherwise indisposed she got a parking ticket the same time vic shot in an alley behind motel off fremont street in fact a lot of cars got tickets that night football coach well i paid coach a visit the guy's 23 just got engaged i mean he'll testify to anything as long his fiancé does n't find out he says that kelsey gave him a roll in the hay asked to intercede with barry-the-bully and get kid leave her little brother alone she did n't kill anyone
catherine; 54; he says that his sister did it oh at a motel with the high school coach no wonder she would n't talk so why is he saying she did
grissom; 54; excuse us who's jeremyspencer do you ever smell a fart and end up blaming the wrong guy
dennisfram; 55; because cause of the last time he beat me up
grissom; 55; why do you think your sister shot barry because why
kelseyfram; 56; i'll protect you i'll fix things so he never comes near you again
dennisfram; 57; she always keeps her word i smelled her perfume i saw barry i saw the gun and i smelled my sister's perfume
grissom; 57; she asked barry's coach to help you that was her protection plan she was nowhere near the high school that night no you smelled her brand of perfume
grissom; 58; we recovered this from your townhouse on a warrant chanteuse we also found the gun it has n't been cleaned you know how to shoot one or eleven captain brass ran a search on you tetrick high school arizona eleven kids shot a few days after columbine you were the assistant principal it says that you were left with post traumatic stress disorder you might want to mention that your lawyer you know miss barrett as difficult high school can be for kids eventually it's over but too soon barryschickel
juliabarett; 58; well i do n't know how to clean a gun that was my husband s do you know how many kids go to school and kill just get relief from the bullying you talked to them boxing lessons and target practice how long before one of them came in here and opened fire on a hallway full kids huh i just thought that one life was better than 20 or 30 i watched them die at my feet just because some sophomore could n't take the jokes about his glasses i did this for my kids
nick; 59; rest in peace
