brass; 1; oh you're going to love this ring any bells rub-a-dub-dub dead man in a tub sleeping bag for easy cleanup open window so the stench alerts neighbors you tell me karnak now that's weird what kind of language is that swedish sure
grissom; 1; it's royceharmon all over again what do you think suicide note in the same place not weird intentional it's backward would you excuse me a minute
brass; 2; okay quincy wants to be alone we had a case like this three months ago guy found dead in his bathtub turned out the suicide was staged found a mini-recorder as suicide note killer may have struck again
grissom; 5; shibley take this recorder to the print lab have manny dust it and run prints on right away photos thank you hey you guys want an assignment slip or a pink i do n't know we'll see
nick; 5; oh uncatchable bro is it true
warrick; 5; throw the flag ref just taking a little coffee break same guy
catherine; 8; that looks like he was shot trying to protect himself forced into the tub at gunpoint stuartrampler was resistant he did n't want to get into that tub too easily he took a few jabs to the temple not a bad start
grissom; 8; similarities what else doc my mind is painting okay let's play it out the killer's got him at gunpoint right standing over him like this but this time things got messy royceharmon did n't fight back that's why there was no muzzle bruising to his temple but the killer just lost round one we know how he gets his vics into the tub and that both deaths were homicides
nick; 11; i do n't know that's why we're up here but he left his buddy hanging out to dry i can tell you that driver ran to this point car picks him up here are your tracks probably took him to the hospital you care to back that statement up my phantom driver against your criminal fifty
warrick; 11; so your drunk driver just got out and ran away where to then how do you explain car number two not if we have these they're kind of out place a walking stride up to the edge no this is a crime not an accident how much i do n't get out of bed for less than a bill
det._evans; 12; hi victim's name is stuartrampler lives in town reserved a room for one night because his house was being fumigated i bagged a couple of utility bills ready for mail it's almost as if he wanted to take care of some unfinished business before checked out it's an upside-down stamp what does that mean
sara; 12; hey evans hmm find anything unusual well it's not likely his suicide was staged i do n't know
det._evans; 13; he wiped it clean
sara; 13; wow this stuff rocks i love bathrooms last time printed a hotel bathroom had over 1,000 prints okay close the doors and hit lights daddy-o not a single print yeah this guy's a real pro not only did he wipe it clean's sterile
catherine; 14; we talked to the second victim's girlfriend played his suicide recording for her she confirmed that it was his voice i know we just need to be absolutely certain do you have a recording of your son's voice so that could tie the killings together
grissom; 14; mrs harmon we believe that the person who did this to your son may have done it someone else and need help anything mrs harmon a home movie a recorded message off your answering machine
paigeharmon; 14; i thought you were going to tell me that caught him well what can i do but i already told you that the voice on tape was not my son s all i have are pictures i may have something royce gave this to me for mother's day last year it's a talking frame it's all i have left i love you too
royceharmon; 14; hey mom it's royce i know you're always complaining do n't hear my voice in the house anymore well now you can listen to it anytime want i love you mom
nick; 15; mr backseat going to make it he well enough to talk all right i get the picture how long until we can see him check his personal effects that's it to what a deuce you bet
warrick; 15; tan lines no watch and ring must have been one hell of a fall to knock his watch and ring off and take his money so what do you say do you want to up the stakes another hundred say my foul play against your phantom driver
gregsanders; 16; okay i've got stuartrampler's dna profile ready all i need is something to compare it well according to the dna stuartrampler licked right-side-up stamps well it came back unknown who
sara; 16; coming right up let's see if we can find out who this licker is what do you got what about the envelope with upside-down stamp he's toying with us anonymous
nick; 17; hey man this is war minor setback how about the 911 call good car was rented from the airport three days ago walterbanglor i figure vegas vacation side trip to hoover dam mm-hmm no no he travels light there was only a change of clothes in the damn suitcase all right the fumes have settled give me a hand you can run but ca n't hide
warrick; 17; supergluing the entire car it's a little excessive do n't you think you know i checked with six different medical centers and no phantom driver at any of them lasvegas cell phone pd's putting a name to it what's all this to makes sense you find his watch and ring my pockets are getting fat god you see all that money in there yeah
catherine; 18; disco placid what's that really a pleasure the mother was wrong that is her son's voice play the second victim's tape no play it through he's just reading from a suicide script what do you think
disco_placid; 18; yeah better leave young thing alone but ai n't no sunshine when she's gone oh that's bill withers man the man cuts me up inside got it right here all i got to do is uh heat this thing up it's a mini-cassette recording of the first victim comparing the i love you s now the talking frame minnesota twins i laid in both suicide notes the computer stripped tracks one by picked this up in the b-ground i do n't know man it sound like a flag or tarp something give me a sec i'll give it to you in a chinese to-go box okay
grissom; 18; he's a jazz producer specializes in audio does voice comparisons for me from time to he hears in perfect pitch he's gifted i'm sorry to hear that catherinewillows disco placid how are we coming with our voice comparisons what is that play them side by it's fill in the blanks
royceharmon; 18; i'm going to kill myself i just ca n't do it anymore i love you mom now you can listen to it anytime want my name is royceharmon i reside at 7642 carpenter street lasvegas nevada i am 41 years of age
mandy; 19; so i've got some good news and mysterious well your results are back from the prints on car and your vicwalter banglor is top of the list you fumed the entire car what did you expect i found some speckles of blue dust in the ridges banglor's print here look it
nick; 19; give me the good news it's a big list let me see i have no idea
warrick; 19; what's the mysterious news what do you think
catherine; 20; okay so maybe it's some reverse or backwards pattern august 17 1958 1957 the suicide message was recorded backwards postage stamp upside-down
grissom; 20; royceharmon born august 17 1958 stuartrampler born august 17 1957 one year apart maybe he's telling us in order to go forward back sara go back one more year august 17 1956 see if anything pops up with the same m.o
sara; 20; i did some comparative digging on both victims royceharmon and stuartrampler both are white males in their 40s single and have the same birthday yeah i'm gone
catherine; 21; what do you mean it's more than one person compliance it's grissom print wait a minute somebody got ahold of your prints well somebody's obviously making this personal they could've got your print from a glass that you touched at restaurant from a latex glove that you discarded and they turned inside out oh god
grissom; 21; can we see the print can you separate them someone within the department what anything you have to say me can her i expected that he's the guy who makes rubber hands i've already cleared him what about the compliance bottom print how i wear gloves at every crime scene i was printed for the job we all were i get it whoever it is telling me that he's got under his thumb
mandy; 21; mr grissom the prints are back from stuartrampler's mini-recorder not print prints it's two thumbprints overlapped yeah running both prints through afis how can that be uh catherine can you excuse us for a moment i need to speak with mr grissom in private well the top print came back paulmillander it came back you
nick; 22; possibly a cop from philly or a nurse from omaha do n't forget the mail carrier from nashville well this is going nowhere no we're still on i may be stalled but'm not out you still think he was robbed
warrick; 22; so who's your phantom driver man it's a rental those prints are probably older than you you giving up you want to take it three tan lines where his ring and watch used to be on vacation in vegas but no money his wallet his face all bruised up before he took that cliffside tumble
walterbanglor; 23; yeah yeah i guess so okay all right all right what okay what are you doing
nick; 24; he lays in wait robs him tries to kill but lets buckle what about the blue dust warrick do n't you think it matters okay like i hate you
warrick; 24; i do n't think the robber expected banglor to get drunk and go crash his car he probably freaked and put him in the back seat trying to fool me into thinking someone else was driving but he only fooled you what about it maybe there's other questions to answer first footprints and tire tracks you love me
grissom; 25; mr millander gilgrissom i'm okay what are you making yeah it reminds me of our supervisor on days i have a couple of questions regarding that staged suicide remember not too well sure i envy you mr millander i do you can work by yourself no one around to bother you just do what i'd love to have that kind of autonomy i know what you mean thank you do you remember the uh rubber hand mold that made from your own well whoever the perpetrator is has killed again and your print came up so i was hoping you could help me the last time we talked you told me that had sold several thousand units halloween could you provide me with a list of your distributors i was hoping to do a credit card search go back ten days before the first murder occurred try and run some names see if any priors pop up of course you do i'm sure you do it well
paulmillander; 25; hey it's the forensics guy i forgot your name i-i'm sorry hi mr grissom it's been a couple of months how are you sir i-i-i call it good versus evil you like so what brings you down to my humble abode yeah how's that going say w-would you like a cup of coffee i got instant it's really all i know i started out doing ice carvings but the artwork never lasted let's sit how can i help you how could i forget sure bestseller yes sir i really do n't have a list uh why i would really love to help you mr grissom but i just do n't keep track of individual purchasers i-i-i'm just a wholesaler i do n't i do n't crunch numbers i-i just spook the children

warrick; 30; what's that
nick; 31; banglor's shooting stick with the phantom driver tosses a few back piles into rental i-93 hoover dam but do n't drink and drive you might spill your drink car skids bangs into the railing see-saws on the edge what does driver do man he bails he leaves banglor in the back seat to take fall literally fingerprints grooves footprints all the bases are covered victim suspect crime scene like a laxative it works you know i hate to admit it but like your theory it does work so what do you think can two solid theories each backed by evidence both be correct
warrick; 31; banglor shooting stick i'll give you that burping bourbons i'll give you that too but he left solo a few miles down the road bentley thief flags him down spooks him into a skid boom crash he's robbed forced into the back pushed over edge with banglor out of the way thief gets in his stolen bentley hightails it there no watch rings cash stolen bentley tire treads converse all-star size 11 all bases covered victim suspect crime scene like a canary it sings i was sitting here thinking the same thing about your phantom driver
catherine; 32; you kill it have we located this bum he's obviously making a point but i do n't think it's peace in terms of human civility or unrest i think maybe it's peace of mind what do you have to attain peace of mind justice
grissom; 32; there there's our guy handing it off life like holding a dove hold it too hard hold it too soft brass's guys are looking for him okay significance of the flipping i'm going to keep doing this over and again until get justice
sara; 32; and it'll fly away what does the dove symbolize peace

walterbanglor; 36; i won the first game yeah yeah i guess it did
warrick; 36; so buckling up really did save your life you know that you get well okay and the bentley thief size 11 he could've been at that crime scene anytime last week so we push on the bet no winner you're talking to the wrong guy
