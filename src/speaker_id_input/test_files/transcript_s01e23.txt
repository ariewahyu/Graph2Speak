brass; 1; eileenjane snow lady she carpools with could n't get her to answer the door police broke in audreyhayes was strangled in her basement and the other one ended up a park m.o is how he breaks in signature's what does once inside
grissom; 1; this is exactly the same as last two different m.o but it's the same signature three or four overpowering blows to the head from a homemade weapon fashioned at scene forces her to drink a mixture of sodium amytal as chemical restraint overligature of the victim and an object rape then he strangles her ejaculates on the bedsheets
brass; 2; sara
grissom; 2; listen no emotions in here that's the pattern it a continuum signature killers never want to get caught and they wo n't stop until do
sara; 2; damn it damn that guy he's escalating grissom guess he wants to get caught
grissom; 4; i wonder what that might mean
sara; 4; i have tape-lifted roll-lifted'm not finding one hair he vacuumed this place before left we've established that he utilizes materials from the victim's domicile hey guys he took the bag
catherine; 5; do n't bother there are n't any just like the last time the guy's mr clean here knock yourself out i'll tell brass to check for sex offenders in a two-mile radius
grissom; 5; he stalked this woman he knew how much time had in this apartment to kill her and clean up after himself yeah have him check peeping toms too five years back that's how they get started it's about crossing boundaries it's like uh with cake you know you're just going to have a little bit of the frosting and end up eating entire plate
sara; 5; thanks
warrick; 5; peeping toms to murderers nobody move mr clean needs a maid i'm going to take this back the lab
grissom; 6; you're bringing the fbi in why i-i do n't believe the investigation should go that way brian i mean roadblocks and special ops
sheriff_brianmobley; 6; gil i need a word with you outside they offered their assistance and i'm inclined to take it of course uh i'd want to make sure you're okay with that
agent_rickculpepper; 7; sheriff mobley hi rickculpepper federal bureau of investigation uh special agent it's great to meet you all our kids back in quantico are always going on about your bugs well listen the fbi is here to help you and your people at csi of course uh as sac the investigation will run through me sheriff probably already told you that all rivers run through rome so to speak but uh you get an attaboy three women dead cause you could n't get the job done there's not many guys who would hand the case over to us fibbies he strangles them near lasvegas boulevard then removes their clothes strip strangler why what do you call him
grissom; 7; gilgrissom agent culpepper no he did n't mention that either i'm not handing it over i'm willing to work in conjunction with you the what unknown signature homicide metropolitan lasvegas
sheriff_brianmobley; 7; maybe you'll feel different when meet rickculpepper rick
agent_rickculpepper; 8; he's not kidding is special agent culpepper you have information for us sir about a man fleeing the scene
grissom; 8; mr uh goggle gilgrissom would you please give detective o'riley a full statement if we have any more questions'll get back to you the last time a security guard tried to help me he ended up dead but thank you i'm late for an autopsy
sydgoggle; 8; i know who you are sir i've seen you on tv i did n't get his license i did n't think of it till this morning but he was really burning rubber though listen if you need any help in your investigation mr grissom
sheriff_brianmobley; 9; he'll need a little patience
dr._albertrobbins; 10; nothing you do n't know trauma to the head with a blunt object overwhelmed her he got a mixture of sodium amytal in her allowed him to control her for up six hours torture her look at the bruises purple means she was alive for all of it same as the others indeterminate object caused severe internal lacerations i did find a small trace of something creviced in the uterine wall looks like an everyday polymer to me
grissom; 10; he choked her unconscious and then brought to multiple times what about the rape be careful nicky the clich√©'s true signatures return to their scenes
nick; 10; what can you tell us a hypnotic percussive control okay i'll go back to the scene try find something like it
dr._albertrobbins; 11; something we did n't find with the other two women fibers one in the back of her throat one stuck between her lower molars hmmm well it would explain why no one hears the victim's screams kind of a forensic smoking gun
grissom; 11; are we done this looks like cotton maybe terry cloth could be silencing them with white bath towels he brings it with him and takes away after so somewhere there's evidence of this victim on a towel
catherine; 12; so we're looking at the same guy what's the red stuff not blood so what this guy's got some strange chemical in his mutated dna
gregsanders; 12; the semen taken from this morning's homicide matches bedsheets of last two female victims yeah but check this out the ejaculate sample mystery substance no freaky huh
grissom; 12; now we just have to find the guy and hope that he has n't done his laundry
catherine; 13; call me oh pertaining to the case well sheriff i'd say let's go to my office but do n't have one
sheriff_brianmobley; 13; catherine you busy i was hoping we might be able to talk about a few things as a jumping-off point
sara; 14; hey warrick you got a second i got this hair that you guys found morning and'm trying to compare it the one we recovered from murder last week hayes girl no i ca n't even tell if we have a dna match there's no skin tag on either one no scalp skin it's almost like this hair was
warrick; 14; what's up and you got a match microscopically but it does n't mean damn thing cause still lead us to the guy whoa a girl defending herself against guy is going to pull that hair out by the roots i mean you get scalp skin filled with dna shed mine
grissom; 15; what meeting i'm going to evidence
nick; 15; hey gil you want to give me the skinny on this meeting of yours i'm on my way back to the crime scene i got paged about the signature case
sara; 15; hey warrick and i just got a break the guy's been planting hairs
warrick; 15; shedding he's trying to throw us off what he does n't realize we got no dna on the hairs so ca chase down his other suspect
agent_rickculpepper; 16; you all got my page good we'll get you a new battery i thought we'd convo about the strangler hear what you've got tell we think our next move should be okay fine got anything to report us we have an operation in place your csi sidle has expressed an interest to my agents in availing herself i wanted to let you know before we made the official offer all this talk about your great capacity for observation sarasidle matches the victim prototype to a t she's young woman brunette tall for female and by all reports she's steady has the right personality for a decoy operation before he kills again yes got a better idea and if he kills again while we're trying to understand him okay if we're to follow your line of thinking are you out ahead him at home later he's learning control
grissom; 16; i did n't would you guys go back to my office please i'll be in a few minutes i'll be happy to pass on any pertinent information you may have my team you first really what kind of operation you're not serious you're going to bait this guy with a human being this is your big fbi plan understanding him first completely so that we can get out ahead of well i'm sorry but he's not going to kill my csi you want to put yourself in the path of a psychotic killer too bad because that's what turns him on women fighting back gives him a greater sense of power when he makes his final kill sit down sara not yet he knows just enough about forensics to be dangerous he thinks's throwing us off track by planting confederate hairs he probably shaves his head maybe entire body as dna protection he may gag his victims using a garden-variety bath towel which then takes with him as part of murder kit he will go after another tall brunette and the torture be worse but this time he wo n't ejaculate at least not the scene signature killers always know their next victim but they do n't know him until he tortures rapes and kills them
sara; 16; i'm going to do it grissom i want to i'm trained in weaponless defense grissom think he knows his next victim
nick; 17; freeze hey get out of there get out of the closet what are you doing all right quiet are you out of your mind i could've killed you this is a crime scene you do n't belong here unless you want me to get the cop at front door'll out of here now and i'd better not see any pictures of this apartment in your paper or'll have the d.a on your front door you did n't scare me mm-mm no
catherine; 18; fast i'm impressed this one of your jokes greg i'm sure this is meaningful sugar water salt and tomato paste ketchup well does he add it after or is organic
gregsanders; 18; you got a hot dog i got the ketchup i went back and looked at the ejaculate from last two murders the same thing indeterminate red stuff it's c12 h22 and o11 nacl h2o tomato paste ketchup do n't ask me why but uh he adds it
catherine; 19; when we zig he zags all of which i'm sure you'll share with the fbi hey is it so bad to avail our lab the resources of federal government i've been listening to our sheriff he says that you wo n't well no he preferred someone from night shift and it may be more than just this case
grissom; 19; i was expecting something a little more elemental yeah well he's not as smart thinks you know i mean ketchup is not going to mask the dna in his semen i'm sure you've been to talking our sheriff yeah i know and if i do n't shape up he going to have ecklie take over the case ah now that the trees are gone i can almost see forest
nick; 20; you guys got a sec he's wearing latex gloves the thick kind too he must know the thin ones leave prints
brass; 21; what about paulmillander maybe he's our guy and uh he had the latex hands and he's a serial maybe our brethren at the fbi have some sort of special database when did you become friendly with feds never make an enemy when you can just as easily a friend fbi's okay i've kissed worse ass but i've got to say do n't like this decoy op the feds are talking up i remember when holly gribbs died i sent her out in the field and she was n't ready i know what you told him
grissom; 21; millander stages suicides in bathtubs with paternal figures this guy's signature is overkill rage against young women it's completely different i did n't think you had that in i told culpepper that he could not have sara
agent_rickculpepper; 22; okay listen up all personnel will be tethered to our decoy by this radio according to captain jamesbrass two of our assailant's victims patronized this specialty grocery store which we are about embark forthwith days before they turned up dead there's a very good chance our assailant will re-frequent this store looking for his next victim lives are at stake i'll take flimsy over nothing okay sidle we're good to go
grissom; 22; this is a pretty flimsy excuse to get your circus up and running do n't you think this is action for's sake culpepper you're risking my csi's life listen to me sara if we study his past can predict future
sara; 22; look this is my idea i want to do something before another girl gets killed and you've been saying that for weeks it's taking too long someone else is going to die and you're still be figuring it out wish me luck
agent_rickculpepper; 23; oh it's three hours expended maybe we should reposition over at that borders book store
grissom; 24; whoa that guy's coming back
male_shopper; 25; would you happen to have a cigarette
agent_rickculpepper; 27; let her play
male_shopper; 27; i've been trying to quit did n't want to buy a pack non-filtered the women i know smoke filtered you those long skinny cigarettes guess it does you got a light you live around here it's probably smart i would n't tell me either you're cute
sara; 27; me too this is my last pack but uh i say that every week so guess it depends on the woman sure yeah maybe i do n't usually give out that kind of information thanks
agent_rickculpepper; 28; all right we're on the move
agent_rickculpepper; 29; let's go yeah culpepper time and coordinate yeah will do all right gentlemen nothing ventured gained i do not believe this is our man murder at the monaco hotel woman found bound in her room stripped and strangled
grissom; 29; what was your first clue sometimes the hardest thing to do is nothing
male_shopper; 29; i'll give it back here
sara; 29; hey he met the profile
agent_rickculpepper; 30; that just means his signature's evolving is n't right grissom i'll transport the witness
brass; 30; he's the husband his name's bradwalden they're locals come here a couple times year he was downstairs playing poker she was up here reading a romance novel he comes back five grand richer he finds her like this
catherine; 30; starting to look like deja vu all over again not it's there or is n't staged i do n't think he made a deposit either
grissom; 30; hmm occasionally i'm struck by the absence of evidence the lamp cord's still attached all the others he yanked cords off look at the table books are n't even disturbed first time in a hotel first time he did n't come in through the window who's that guy husband let's bring him in witness
dr._albertrobbins; 31; i posted the lady from hotel and have to say it's same menu as last three chemical restraint overligature death by strangulation no this one's different cross-hatched leather with tiny air holes for breathing i was thinking driving gloves or weightlifting
grissom; 31; what did you get what about the object-rape indeterminate polymer different how
agent_rickculpepper; 32; i'm not accusing you of anything but a man and his wife get hotel room for romantic weekend then spend that whole apart makes me wonder if there's trouble in the marriage read this man his rights please you're under arrest for the murder of jenniferwalden and eileen snow and tracyberg
bradwalden; 32; i like to gamble she liked to read it was you know just the perfect getaway yeah i have a key on my keychain car keys no uh w-why well i-i you know if it does i read that this uh you know character uses whatever is at the scene of crime for killing his victims
grissom; 32; you liked to play golf too these are your golf clubs we found them in your hotel room i prefer a titanium driver mr walden i'd like to see what you use but your carrier is locked so you wo n't mind opening it though well so i can see if the leather on your club handles matches from object used to violate wife well if this character killed your wife how did he get your clubs out of the case without keys or for that matter back into the case after he killed your wife
agent_rickculpepper; 33; what do you mean every piece of the signature is there for what possible reason you know this is where i like to reference the majesty and power of republic united states america and that golfer just got lucky the victim type fits his wife to a texas t is it duly noted supervisor grissom duly noted
grissom; 33; you ca n't charge him for the other women for the murder of his wife maybe but i am certain that he did n't do others he read the papers piggybacked on top of killer who knows convenient way out of a lousy marriage he's not our guy go ahead pull rank but that hotel crime scene was staged to look like the signature s if you stop and think'll see it
agent_rickculpepper; 35; we believe that bradleymac walden not only killed his wife but also took the lives of audreyhayes and eileen snow tracyberg our field agents have divulged that mr walden lived within two miles of the other victims worked in same office building as ms snow and has no believable explanation for his whereabouts on dates their murders we believe that bradleymac walden found and stalked these victims this statement is concluded lasvegas its locals and visitors can rest a little easier tonight a suspect is in custody thank you
catherine; 35; i just talked with brass he said that walden was having an affair with a dentist in his office
grissom; 35; i'm telling you this guy did not kill those other women
catherine; 36; politics
grissom; 36; no
agent_rickculpepper; 37; that's all the information we have
grissom; 38; he's not viable brian for those who have to ask no answer could suffice oh do i get the weekend off
sheriff_brianmobley; 38; the fbi did me a favor being here and they have viable suspect then further investigation will prove that out in the meantime people will feel better about their daily lives now why on earth would you want to counteract that look i see we've come to an impasse if further investigation determines that walden did n't kill those other women then you can rejoin the for starters and a two-week holiday anywhere but csi you brought this on yourself now the next time you want to play with my career maybe'll think twice
catherine; 39; that may have been the problem
grissom; 39; no i'm off it's all catherine she's the boss good luck
nick; 39; you know it's not fair grissom you know more about signatures than most of them put together
warrick; 39; is there's no one you can appeal to come on this guy's the loose and there nothing you can do
catherine; 40; hey your door was open you okay migraine it's been a while you just do n't like it when ca solve a case or command your troops i told the sheriff'd pass well if i get a promotion want it to be on merit not because you're politically tone-deaf so our guys are outside in their tahoes if you're a civilian we are except we are putting in for overtime
grissom; 40; i'm not used to having people in my house did you come here to tell me about your new job you do n't want to be a supervisor
grissom; 41; we should reexamine each victim all the evidence pertaining to one individually well then go back to your crime scenes and look for a persistence of fibers something's better than nothing
nick; 41; all right well i got dibs on eileen snow and i have a strong feeling'm going to be the one break case
sara; 41; tracyberg
warrick; 41; i got audreyhayes but those fibers we found in the snow lady's throat are n't going to give us anything white cotton fibers are like oxygen they're everywhere if you ca n't prove uniqueness abundance yeah
catherine; 42; this guy showed up on the database yeah well do n't act like it's so simple this guy could have gone another year without being picked up what did they get him on oh suspended sentence released two days ago call grissom on his cell he is dial
gregsanders; 42; hunter f baumgartner our ketchup dna guy codis updates its database every couple weeks well indecent exposure caught in an alley behind the monaco i thought he was off the case
catherine; 43; you think anything illegal goes on in here we're with the crime lab heard you just copped a plea for indecent exposure how do you explain your dna on the bedsheets they were murdered in any recent trick offer you money for something a little weird say a portable sample of your dna i guess we should have known if our guy was planting hairs he semen
grissom; 43; excuse me hunter uh-uh you recognize any of these women do you know them yeah i do n't know does get it pal dna's like fingerprints no two samples are alike you were in these women's bedrooms would you be able to recognize any of these guys
hunter_baumgartner; 43; yeah you two look like made a wrong turn somewhere i'm sorry working yeah strip strangler girls they are all over tv no i do n't know believe me mister the last place that you will find is in a woman's bedroom unless we're discussing window treatments hey and my indecent was for tricking too close to the boulevard i do n't know anything about killing women that's straight boy stuff only about ten times this month this is vegas well i'd have to be looking at them in the face now would n't
grissom; 44; probably in little hollowed-out packets of ketchup could have been the staging area maybe he wears his murder kit call brass tell him to meet you guys there let me know
sara; 44; i did n't really find anything instructive but warrick hit pay dirt the frequented locations report said none of women belong to a gym where he could have spotted them which i do all the time it's a free workout and you do n't have to sign up and of course get a list the club's male gym members
warrick; 44; well i went back audreyhayes apartment and paid particular attention to the point of entry i found a small persistence of white cotton fibers well i remember what you said about signature guys and how they have low self-esteem they're always going to the gym work out so i'm thinking towels so i went back to see if any of them had tried out introductory offers but you do have to sign in all three women went to strong's gym once in the last months so i'm going back there grab some towels bring them to the lab see if can get a match from crime scene fibers
grissom; 45; grissom i remember that guy hmm
nick; 45; yeah i'm looking in front of eileen snow's apartment this security guard said he saw a guy burn rubber out of there tight eileen's murder yeah well there's no rubber here on the pavement or curb a coup of oil spots that's about it and i called brass nobody took any photographs of tire marks not the lasvegas p.d not the feds
agent_rickculpepper; 46; the only shift csi i can actually find you're tampering with evidence of the united states government there mr stokes well tell your girlfriend she's going to have you out of a job best thing you could do for your boss protect him from himself
nick; 46; mm-hmm i was just looking for a quiet spot to call my girlfriend grissom i got to run peanut love you too
grissom; 47; goggle sydgoggle
nick; 47; bye-bye
sydgoggle; 47; if you need any help in your investigation mr grissom
grissom; 48; mr goggle sydgoggle these investigations are always in flux am i uh interrupting your laundry you were so meticulous about many things shaving the gloves planted evidence that's why i do n't understand you'd bring towels eventually could be tracked strong's gym that's where the women told you to get lost right stuffing club towels down their throat make your point in theory but the truth is every object changed by its owner by his habits his washing machine for instance his detergent your towel is caught in the agitator now see that's going to leave distinctive marks on the fabric syd and that's just the beginning i've had a look at your garbage your garbage is in a public area plain sight it's enough for me to get a warrant
sydgoggle; 48; gilgrissom i thought you were too busy with the fbi to talk me i'm just doing some gym towels i do n't know what you're talking about you know the thing with women is they work out because want us to look at them and then they parade around and you just want to say hello everybody knows white cotton fibers are n't like fingerprints they ca n't be traced you do n't get a match on towel the totality of microscopic elements it's locard theory you were in my apartment now nothing from there's admissible in court
agent_rickculpepper; 49; everybody okay special agents we got a shooting notify lvpd and paramedics asap
catherine; 49; you all right nick told me
grissom; 49; yeah how did you know i was here i just wanted to talk him
sheriff_brianmobley; 51; we can say unequivocally based on statements made by a certain local law enforcement employee and corresponding evidence that the deceased syd booth goggle is strip strangler furthermore since goggle was killed by a second member of lasvegas law enforcement during his apprehension this case is now closed i would like to thank the fbi along with special agent rickculpepper for his invaluable leadership in this pursuit in short we could n't have done it without you
grissom; 52; i believe catherine was going to requisition one
nick; 52; give me some of that you uh got me right war
sara; 52; do we have a breakfast budget grissom good cause our plates are up and nobody has any money
