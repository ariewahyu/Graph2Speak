grissom; 1; there you go detective good morning catherine he was steve wynn before
brass; 2; wish i had tonybraun's gardener working for me guy sniffed it out from the jump blinds were drawn shut side gate unlocked dogs let out a plus b c equals 9-1-1 so the rumors about ol tony boy are true drug overdose
catherine; 2; chasing the dragon a pinch of h heat the foil inhale the fumes it sure seems that way
grissom; 2; all seems very neat and peaceful does n't it with a xanax back 100 pills prescription filled yesterday if only life were that simple
sara; 4; eight rolls two copies case is hot put a rush on it
grissom; 5; looks like somebody did he's got adhesive residue on his wrists well that would be the obvious welcome or unwelcome did somebody clean him up curious is n't it initially when i saw the tv on
sara; 5; lose an earring he was restrained some sort of tape braun had company where's the purge car blows its engine there's an oil leak a guy ods where's the body fluid urine vomit excrement interesting love bites on the chest and he's posed when did you know this was a homicide and not an o.d yeah
catherine; 6; well i'll tell you one thing if those were my dogs would n't be leaving this gate open gardener said it was the first time in five years that he'd found this gate unlocked last morning of tonybraun's life well either somebody inside the house opened it or had a key because this lock has n't been forced there's no pry marks no metal shavings
nick; 6; yeah you're talking about a dog owner on heroin how responsible can he be what's so different about this morning so why was the gate open
brass; 7; how would you know yeah looks like the guy had a pill for everything can you get a print off those balloons
warrick; 7; a heroin addict's confetti nothing like going on a binge black tar heroin this is the difference between a cadillac and pinto it's my job i count at least six balloons and that's just in the bedroom the dealer must have come down chimney it's like christmas in july here not that braun even needed any more drugs
grissom; 8; any luck what about the cans outside
sara; 8; i have gone through every garbage can in the house first thing i checked zip
grissom; 10; hey doc these abrasions around his mouth what hard to shave when you're stoned petechial hemorrhaging also suggestive of suffocation these three circular red marks on his chest they're not bug bites cpr was n't performed
robbins; 10; leg fell asleep i always wondered which one of us coroners would get to carve tony his lifestyle was no secret sex drugs and a big bankroll no needle marks on his arms the guy plays golf short-sleeved shirts checked between toes groin area whatever he did went up his nose his nasal cavity looks like raw hamburger or they're pressure marks for example if someone places a pillow or object against's nose and mouth in the climate of struggle not always for as much pathology is an absolute science it n't vessels can rupture under innocent circumstances such as a violent cough no neurotoxins present but that's not to say some overanxious paramedic trying save a legend life did n't cause them in the moment then i do n't know what they are
janinehaywood; 11; excuse me boy are you lucky my lawyer's on a golf course i've been standing out here in the heat for hours answering these stupid questions here's your answer okay this is my house okay
brass; 12; it's braun squeeze she's an ex-stripper too perhaps you two met in a professional capacity uh let's see quote out endquote when tony's drug dealer showed up she split she slept at a friend's house she did n't like the way tony acted when he was cruising on magic carpets
catherine; 12; who's this and uh where has she been the past 12 hours
janinehaywood; 12; these are my things oh my god
brass; 13; why do n't you just put the camera away before get arrested that's a lawyer call
catherine; 13; right now your house is our crime scene and we can do whatever want that includes fingerprinting you thumb to pinkie of course you are
janinehaywood; 13; listen if anything is missing from this house i'm going to add you my lawyer's sue list you ca n't arrest me in my own house why did n't do anything i just lost my boyfriend okay you're a woman i'm just looking out for my end here you know things start to disappear if tony were here right now he'd tell you himself just make sure janine's taken care of hey i'm in the will
catherine; 14; yeah is sambraun in would you let him know that catherinewillows is here to see
catherine; 15; yeah well that was a long time ago i know but you were married and was a baby it would've never worked
sambraun; 15; mugs i remember the first time saw you you did n't have any clothes on i would've taken you home right then if could have
sambraun; 16; i'll take care of it you go back to the pit make sure nobody's robbing us blind
waltbraun; 16; hey dad i got the press clogging up valet should i call security or just handle it what
catherine; 17; yeah sounds like tony sam the bigger pedestal target well that's business what about personal did you ever talk to tony about any of his girlfriends janinehaywood yeah i do
sambraun; 17; you know back in uh 67 i was my 20s and i was drinking in a dive downtown buffalo at the end of bar was this pro quarterback drinking double scotches two t time midnight to 7:00 in morning it's sunday game day mind you so you know what i did called my bookie bet against him guess what i'll be damned if he did n't throw six touchdown passes you know even when tony was juicing he could run circles around these college harvard types and i'm not saying that just because my kid tony was the best damn casino exec this town has ever seen and just between you me i could n't hold a candle to him now he's dead overdose nobody shoots at that target without going through me what do you mean which one i mean they were all trying to pick the gold out of his teeth she's the worst and he loved her most can you believe it if i know her type now that she has the gold'll be going after silver
catherine; 18; okay on the left braun prints we got from coroner and right gold digger i janinehaywood and good thing or bad
grissom; 18; here's where it gets interesting i took six prints off this bottle they all belong to one person it's good if you're us bad if you're janinehaywood
warrick; 18; have you seen brass
grissom; 19; not tonight no why
warrick; 19; oh print off air orange balloon cyanoacrylate dead bang drug dealer
grissom; 20; where did you get it
sara; 20; ooh watch it evidence cracker box it was all stuck together muckety-muck i do n't want to ruin any potential prints but saw this tv dinner commercial and it hit me
greg; 21; oh do n't touch it that's my pot yeah you know from my own private stash blue hawaiian 40 a pound only grown a couple times year on the big island hand-picked to perfection oh is that alcohol on a bug bite that's like butter on burns man wives tale it worked did n't
grissom; 21; did you try this coffee the last cup i had tasted like motor oil your pot good you're using my water so i guess that makes it community coffee you want a cup nick what's the matter with your leg
nick; 21; mm-mmm translation no no thanks i do n't know man something back at that house must have bit me yeah this is the guy who told me to put hemorrhoid cream on my acne
grissom; 22; this is pretty good let me see the bite before you get gangrene chigger bite probably picked it up walking through the ferns in braun's backyard see if catherine's got some clear nail polish it'll seal off from the air keep itching ah whatever happened with that doggy door be sure to check it against janinehaywood's prints
nick; 22; yeah something definitely two-legged went through it got mostly partials print lab's working on it now
brass; 23; based on your pupes i could take you in right now
catherine; 23; i thought he inhaled it he ate it well braun was a heroin addict using heavy just before he died which means probably meek as lamb and make him drink hemlock it's a lot easier to pour liquid down guy throat than is make him swallow hundred pills
grissom; 23; xanax where are all the undissolved pills most od's die before digestion complete right okay so what do we know that can write home about would n't have taken much to bind his hands with duct tape how many
robbins; 23; braun's stomach contents no food plenty of drugs and heroin inhaled and ingested got there somehow did n't find any my guess someone mashed up the xanax dissolved them in red wine which i did find it was n't a hundred pills educated unofficial guess no more than fifty
brass; 24; when did you last deliver well she told us as soon you got there left what shave the soul patch
warrick; 24; you're braun's grocery store
brass; 25; first time i heard that got you a brand-new mercedes did n't it look when you left your half a house where did go well let's get her on the line let me guess she's incommunicado
catherine; 25; not lately we found fifty xanax in tony's stomach i'll tell you what left your fingerprints all over the prescription bottle
janinehaywood; 25; i told you dropped them down the bathroom sink look i took two gave tony and accidentally dropped fifteen or twenty down the sink it was an accident you know an accident have n't you ever spilled a drink do n't pin that on me i'd left i went to the pharmacy waited in line picked up prescription signed for it brought back house you know tony did nothing for himself except work and get high yes it did and it'll buy me the dress i wear at tony's funeral too a friend s she's out of town that means you ca n't reach her
catherine; 26; oh mind the dummy
greg; 27; well with all due respect sir it's not a baked potato it's braun blood and with all the impurities in his system might take a little extra time did i ever tell you used to live in new york excuse me you know heroin has a nine-minute half-life after that it metabolizes into morphine a hundred fifty-eight nanograms per mil definitely not lethal the same with your xanax quarter-mil tabs hundred micrograms per liter again not lethal there's addicts walking around times square with more drugs in their system oh i was just going to tell you about another way take heroin a suppository up the coolee you just stand on your head and then let gravity forget it
grissom; 27; it's been 24 minutes greg when's this thing going to be done is this going to be a short story or novel what's the 6-mam count so braun should still be walking around and the point of your new york story was
catherine; 28; i figured so why'd i bring the dummy braun's shirt is this part of the sherlock holmes fan club kit so braun would have been on his third or fourth balloon by then but when you're doing drugs a slob and being manhandled even sloppier like this he was burked
grissom; 28; braun did n't die of a drug overdose accidental or otherwise robbins opened him up his lungs were compressed remember burke and hare the two 19th century scottish body snatchers who made a living intoxicating innocent victims suffocating them sold their cadavers to teaching hospitals got away with it too until a medical student discovered his fiancée on slab janinehaywood said that she left the house when drug dealer arrived i think she came back would have been easy to tape his wrists mash up fifty pills and force-feed him a xanax cocktail so everything was going great until the gardener showed up then i think her plan turned to panic it takes time to od janine did n't have burke would kneel on his victim's chest right covering their mouth and nostrils hello where brass you're breaking up
brass; 29; anybody ever tell you to call before dig oh is that right from who a dead man you got a name do me a favor curtritten put down the shovel stand over there
curtritten; 29; hey what's going on i got permission to be here my name's curtritten look tonybraun was a friend of mine right this is his property he calls me about a month ago he says if anything should happen to me you start digging you take care of what's mine at all costs that i'm doing okay
brass; 31; hey guys you might want to check out the basement
catherine; 31; that's a lot of motive
grissom; 31; a sable cloud turns forth its silver lining to the night and a lot of silver
sara; 32; nice let's see if that where my print came from oh listen to you would you rather hit a home run in the fourth or bottom of ninth let me ask you something braun collected silver coins bullion 23 tons of it why bury it in blue diamond what good's collecting silver coupons when you're dead
warrick; 32; okay three rolls of tape found in the truck owned by curtritten no match cause he was smart in the past 20 years value of silver's gone to nothing and a commodity broker's going to charge you storage fee per troy ounce and there's only one thing worse than losing seven to eight percent on silver a year and that's losing nine to ten percent because of some stupid storage fee depends on who's doing the clipping oh we got a positive association roll to tape curt to tony
brass; 33; no burglary theft and conspiracy to start how'd you know where the silver was buried ever work on his house oh so you've been to his house tools of the trade curt construction items hammer duct tape yeah well whatever you do n't tell us we'll find it
curtritten; 33; you arresting me for digging tony asked me to move his silver collection up ranch in wyoming i'm doing what was told look i had nothing to do with the drugs i swear to you have n't messed around with that stuff in a long time i was always telling tony as a friend to get off of it walk away because i built the vault for him i'm a contractor that's what i do no we did talk about me building a basement for him once it never got off the ground we were friends i've been to his house plenty of times i was there a couple weeks ago we were watching the notre dame game together yeah i brought a six-pack and some chips sour cream why would i do that i got no idea what you're talking about
grissom; 33; mr ritten it appears that we may have physical evidence connecting you to the murder of tonybraun did you ever leave anything there did you ever bring anything over to his house
catherine; 34; yep braun family long arms i thought you said that ritten's wife lives in carson city or digging up silver mrs ritten criminalistics i do n't have to ask you that question
janinehaywood; 34; geez you scared me how'd you get in here
sara; 35; you're telling us the prints on that tape are n't his or hers this is ridiculous
warrick; 35; how can this be mandy we found the duct tape in guy's truck this thing must have a virus well that's easy for you to say all you do is scan prints day and hit enter
nick; 37; no came back waltbraun
sara; 37; your prints came back unknown too
warrick; 37; see what i mean
catherine; 38; he's tonybraun brother he's a pit boss at the tangiers which is why his prints were on file gaming card go figure the more evidence that shows up this case does n't make sense we got two suspects in custody and neither of their prints are on the duct tape mm-hmm it's been done they're not waltbraun's prints on the tape came back unknown
grissom; 38; who is he he's family why's he using the doggie door and not front or on the doggie door but brother's are so call the print lab
brass; 39; hey i've got detective vega rounding up waltbraun apparently this janinehaywood really got around when she was n't at braun's house playing girlfriend over vault boy flat mistress which gives neither of them a credible alibi then i let the girlfriend go curtritten goes back to lock-up until he posts bail
catherine; 39; flimsy alibis do n't prove murder what else have we got without curt's prints on it
grissom; 39; nothing probative look forget curt forget janine forget the suspects it's simple we got to figure out how a piece of duct tape from roll found in curtritten's truck ended up wrapped around the wrists our victim
bonnieritten; 40; oh you're going to take this too huh i come down here with a check to bail my husband out and you say him we're of no honey you're out of here take it easy how many men do you need huh i've stuck by you through the bankruptcies flings lies and have had it okay so you choose me or her
brass; 40; bail processing is this way
curtritten; 40; bonnie bonnie take it easy sorry janine
janinehaywood; 40; curt we're out of here hey at least i can take care of mine yeah heard that before call me
grissom; 41; it's a quirk i always like to discuss fingerprints in person how long ago be more specific
waltbraun; 41; you came down here to ask me about a doggie door i could've just told you over the phone hmm tony and i went to dinner a while back uh about a month and half ago
waltbraun; 42; my key still works here how come it does n't work on the front door
grissom; 43; you ca n't replace your brother what's the matter with your leg mind if i take a look i'm an entomologist actually i-i know all about bugs chigger bites you might want to try some nail polish keep it from itching would you mind if i took a photograph for my bite collection we're almost done in the uh last 48 hours have you been anywhere else besides those two places it might just get a little more routine
waltbraun; 43; when you're a braun there's nothing ca n't replace i do n't know something must've bit me what are you a dermatologist sure can you tell me what to put on it it's killing me whatever rubs your buddha shoshone hi-rise j.w brown road yeah i'm a glorified pit boss no my life's pretty routine
grissom; 44; nick i need your leg show me your bite hey what time did you log in at the braun house how long after that did you start processing the backyard you're not the only one with chigger bites waltbraun it's now 9:30 at night approximately 36 hours ago you were bitten three hours earlier than that tonybraun was murdered chiggers run a predictable course a chigger attaches itself to hair follicle injects digest enzyme into the skin which ruptures surrounding cells allowing suck em up leaving behind red itchy bump waltbraun lied we now have an entomological timeline that places him at the house on day his brother was murdered
nick; 44; oh it's no worries i got some cream all right it's no big deal really 9:15 that morning about a half hour who is this so ah i do n't know boss i mean ask yourself the question are doggie-door prints and chigger bites enough to get a man for murder
brass; 45; well i got motive according to the family lawyer drug addict i'm calling it what is i know you're friends with the family but guy used heroin he was a drug addict who stood in line to inherit old man's fortune walt's out of the picture he's left out in the cold yeah tony promised he'd take care of him whatever he got split 50-50 all in silver included up until about a month ago
catherine; 45; what've we got now jim that's just a little callous he is so wait a second janine the stripper claims that half of everything is hers's actually more than just wishful thinking i just got the references off of waltbraun gave samples to greg
grissom; 45; what evidence do we have that's still open we have to deal with that earring
nick; 45; but tony changed his mind which the will so what's right in front of us that we're missing
sara; 45; what about the brother curt was digging up the silver to protect janine's interest couple of things on the priority list that have n't been processed yet tape lifts adhesive residue i got earring back where'd you find living room near the body
warrick; 45; bet walt was n't too happy about that it's 50-50 going 75-25 the wrong way
catherine; 46; mm-hmm are you finished open your mouth what about the maid wow you got this whole thing down do n't
grissom; 46; ms haywood you have pierced ears how about your girlfriends or tony's any of them wear studs how often does she vacuum hmm the day tony died
janinehaywood; 46; you want to swab me go ahead but i can save the-tip that's really not my style yeah he does n't understand i do n't wear studs have n't worn studs since like god seventh grade can i see that picture thanks see this is an earring back it goes to a stud earring i do n't wear studs i'm more of like a dangle gal i like chandeliers they move with you they're on wires they do n't have a back look rule number one no women allowed in the house tony had a wandering eye he wad of cash who needed that drama no rule number two heavyset over 50 no makeup jewelry english yeah this is my house i did n't do anything wrong and i inherited josie she cleans real good every day except on her day off
catherine; 47; the earring back was lost that day so i guess rule number one was broken there was a woman in the house are you thinking what i'm she lives in carson city she has access to curt's truck hell hath no fury
greg; 47; there well maybe not the earring back not janine s but it was in the ear of a female
grissom; 47; well if the maid is as good janine says she then whoever's prints are on the duct tape is missing an earring back who's the only other woman in story she's here now we saw the fight in police department
bonnieritten; 48; it's not mine i do n't wear earrings yeah so what i'm not giving you anything
brass; 48; will you volunteer us a dna sample it will confirm your story or ours so you were at tony's house the morning he died along with waltbraun whose prints we confirmed on the doggy door
catherine; 48; if you do n't wear earrings for a while the holes will close up you should've let your husband rot in jail we lifted your thumbprint from the check that you posted for his bail just like a pair of earrings identical
grissom; 48; it's funny just recently i had a little education in earrings and noticed that you have pierced ears it's okay jim we have enough we compared it to a set of unknown prints that found on some duct tape at the crime scene
brass; 50; news flash sweetheart ca n't make a deal if you keep your mouth shut
catherine; 50; what i do n't get is you and waltbraun did move in the same circles how'd the two of you hook up
curtritten; 50; that's the thing about murder you never think to have a backup plan the dogs lead gardener right to you
grissom; 50; you know sometimes doing the job that we do our biggest break comes from most innocent circumstance it was the maid's day off but not gardener s so you had to wing it the gardener came to window but he did n't see you so removed the tape from tony's wrists and made it look like an od
curtritten; 51; hey janine you're lookin good
waltbraun; 51; that's the thing about my father he could never give advice but had a million stories scorpion and the frog scorpion needed to get across the creek and asked frog for a ride frog says i ca n't trust you're a scorpion sure can hops on the's back midway across the scorpion stings frog frog looks at him why would you do that now we're both gon na die scorpion says i ca n't help it i'm a scorpion if tony had n't thrown a party the two of us would never have been standing at that bar
bonnieritten; 52; no my husband's bimbo bonnieritten
waltbraun; 52; you're looking at my brother's trophy waltbraun
brass; 53; ai n't love grand
grissom; 53; and an opportunity presented itself tony had erased you from the will and bonnie wanted people that hurt her to pay
catherine; 54; it's not your fault it's human nature we ca n't deny our feelings hey sam you still got me well considering i was six months old when you guys lit the flame a lot of time has passed you had plenty of chances
sambraun; 54; you know this could've all been his his and tony s sure it is i committed the cardinal sin loved one son more than other but you can hide it and i did n't they're my sons i made them raised and one kills the other you know i should've married your mother just was n't in the cards catherine it just was n't in the cards
