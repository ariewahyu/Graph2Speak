kimmarita; 8; excuse me
warrick; 8; miss we're from the crime lab you found the deceased
brass; 9; yeah i was born yesterday
catherine; 9; hey brass you touch this body well it looks as if the sash may have been tied by somebody else
catherine; 10; miss you know anything about redressing the body did you move the body here too actually it is
kimmarita; 10; well she was naked i thought she should be covered guests were looking in i put a robe on her it's not like a crime or anything
warrick; 10; makes us doubt the circumstances surrounding victim's death
grissom; 11; but what kind all purpose self rising pastry what about the neck any fibers in the wound well that hasn t stopped you yet be my guest dress shirt but no tie find me on the flour
sara; 11; flour maybe trace will probably have a better idea i'll get dna to see if there's bits of ben under the fingernails you told me to wait for i did observe some fibers in the wound i didn t collect them though yellow not cotton satin maybe strangled with his own tie
catherine; 12; ms marita did the deceased use jacuzzi facilities this evening it's uh not uncommon to drown in a jacuzzi hair gets caught in the whirl a person dragged under the hotel wouldn t be considered unsafe
kimmarita; 12; not that i remember no what you do n't believe me well that didn t happen here she did not drown on these premises
robbins; 12; oliverdunne
warrick; 12; shelleydanvers appointment 8 00 well you lied to us before well if she did the coroner would find water in her lungs but it'd be worse hearing from him than you
grissom; 13; you get all that from his uh dentals 380s that's not what killed him is it we pulled a yellow fiber out of the neck wound i think it's from his tie
robbins; 13; father of two his wife widow she came down to i d his property last one i recovered entered through his abdominals pierced the liver lodged in oblique you might be right he died of asphyxiation tie probably closed the windpipe without oxygen the alveoli capillaries wither and dry up whole pulmonary system shut down what you may have here is the smallest sliver of murder weapon
grissom; 14; so why did you rule out bakeries
sara; 14; i can not tell you why but might be able to where a pizza shop the flour on oliverdunne has a low gluten content seven percent protein it's typical of used to make cakes pizzas that kind thing well the subtype of flour is another double zero it's a very fine flour used only in pizza baking ovens oh and trace picked up some oregano in the sample
benjaminjennings; 15; i lost it yeah um it's a place called dante pizzeria it's behind the strato well i deliver the pizzas it's too hot back there with all the ovens and stuff no well i do n't have to talk look if you know so much about these murders what do need me for
brass; 15; you're the registered owner of a lorcin 380 takes the same caliber bullet as slugs we took out of victim so i'm going to ask you one more time where's your gun do you think we believe that do you think
grissom; 15; are you employed ben you make pizzas do you uh ever come into contact with the baking flour at dante s well cause we found flour on the victim and it's kind that used to make pizza can you explain that ben why do n't you earn yourself some points by telling me what the science is going to tell anyway no but we're going to figure it out murders there are more bodies
grissom; 16; hold up isolate it
nick; 16; i feel like'm mowing a lawn zilch do n't tell me more zilch
sara; 16; what is that a beer can soda can whoa point of disturbance grissom
benjaminjennings; 17; no mr grissom i'm not a bad person
grissom; 17; any more bodies you want to tell me about we're going to radar this whole hillside sometimes when i leave a crime scene where've been particularly involved with dead body sit in my car and it hits me how close was heavy the is texture of feels you know you're not a bad person then what are you
catherine; 18; oh i hope that's shelleydanvers the woman from hotel spa well it's about time you guys finished with day shift runover huh yeah well the victims families hate it when we don t good morning she didn t drown anything probative from cover up
robbins; 18; i'll take it from here david catherine no serosanguineous fluid expunged from the mouth or nose rules out your jacuzzi theory bright red lividity extending down the body well heatstroke possibly stroke could cause multiple organ failure and if i'm right
catherine; 19; brass i need you to get records from that hotel spa a warrant if we it yep that's right bye yeah was our girl staying with anyone at that hotel we need someone to give us the truth about last night
robbins; 19; catherine
warrick; 19; oh it's on uh yeah tinatina kolas best friends from terre haute indiana flew here in a package why
father_powell; 20; gilgrissom benjamin's a member of my parish the officer won t let me talk to him he said you were in charge he needs spiritual guidance ah then you'd have no problem with my talking to him eleventh hour can you think of a better time
grissom; 20; father of this crime scene yeah i imagine he does it's the 11th hour i wouldn t expect anything less when the reality of their actions set in they usually turn to religion
grissom; 21; okay hold it that's enough let's dust him see if this laceration on guy's forehead is consistent with the kid shovel
nick; 21; no ligature marks hey i feel a wallet here ramirezkenny a 25 year old latino and 42 white guy
sara; 21; different from the first guy strangers doesn t make sense there's no connection
grissom; 22; they didn t happen to find another car there did
nick; 22; hey oriley what's the matter man a c not working yeah gas station
sgt._o'riley; 22; hey i was on with dispatch oliverdunne's car was just found by the highway patrol abandoned at an avcon station off 215 yeah registered to a ramirez
catherine; 23; and you can verify that when shelley went to the hotel spa last night she was going use dry sauna you said have proof that shelley used the dry sauna hotel surveillance would love that you're sure she used that phone to make the appointment
tinakolas; 23; we'd been drinking apple martinis for like three days straight shelley said the sauna would detox her you know clean out mine shelley and i got in a fight over it yesterday i caught her trying it on and said give back then we started fighting over you know tug of war the whole thing ripped right in two we fell back laughing i'd give anything to have her back no go ahead if it'll help she called down from this phone do they tape phone calls here yeah okay but it doesn t have anything on
warrick; 23; cath whose shirt is this when we're going to take this shirt if you do n't mind we're going to take this as well well that's okay
nick; 24; you do n't just miss something like that what was going on okay all right just walk us through it when did you know there'd been a crime committed i do n't see any blood
sara; 24; two men were shot and killed you didn t see anything you what
warrick; 24; we do magic
father_powell; 25; h hello mr grissom uh they told me out front i'd find you here priest's collar people trust it most people even lapsed catholics first time we met you called me father only romans do that everybody else it's reverend or minister i wanted to know how your investigation against ben is going i didn t come here to tamper with your evidence he was a good kid all through school still comes to mass every sunday if he has a problem it's trying to please people it can be he wouldn t do this to whom much is given will be expected i leave you to your work
grissom; 25; i do n't see your uh visitor's badge what makes you think uh i was ever a catholic this is his car you know really shouldn t be here is that a problem this luminol reveals dried blood i believe the car
catherine; 26; that's okay cause we do esda can read this blank paper see what's written on it up to 14 layers that's miss danvers handwriting we confirm that
kimmarita; 26; i told you we have no record shelleydanvers specifically used the dry sauna so she took a dry sauna what does that prove
warrick; 26; sometimes a simple flashlight will do the trick she died of a heat stroke the coroner just called in with results of his final post your sauna's kept in the optimal condition for heat stroke 182 degrees that could kill a person if you left them longer than two straight hours
brass; 27; especially if no one checks up on them a hotel employee is supposed to check on the various saunas every 15 minutes hotel regulations right we uh got a copy of the check up sheet no hotel employee checked in on the sauna after 7 30 p m
catherine; 27; so shelley was in here from 8 00 until what time did you call 9 1 you moved her into the locker room put the robe on her from negligent homicide
kimmarita; 27; i um i came in at closing 10 00 miss oh my god i was just trying to protect the hotel
grissom; 28; good work you guys very good but you haven t proved murder you've proved burial from burying them he transported them show me the gun with ben's prints on it gun shot residue the ligature yes empirical evidence st thomas was ahead of us all no it has to do with the evidence okay ship it show it to the'd a
nick; 28; murder scene was compromised a lorcin 380 the same pistol registered to a benjaminjennings and we can prove he transported those bodies in his vehicle based on the blood you found we i'd d the fibers using ftir it's a polymer commonly used in vehicle carpeting they're identical bottom line he killed them excuse me victim blood in his car it's our job to present the'd a with the best evidence possible let a jury decide anything else we're playing judge the evidence doesn t get any better than this right
sara; 28; pump jockey wasn t very helpful but bullets pulled from victim one and two p d can prove through credit cards that ben frequents the avcon gas stations where both vics were killed and fibers i recovered a burgundy fiber from the sock of victim one found the same fiber on sock of victim two so we went back to ben's car we got the master standards from car manufacturer the assigned name for material is 12 ounce merlot poly victim blood on his clothes under his nails the holes in christ's hands doubting thomas does this have anything to do with the priest that's been coming around here
brass; 29; anyone up for breakfast well i guess'll go see tina alone hotel tells me she's down playing quarter slots well my guy in the hotel lounge tells me that tina and shelley were having a catfight over some dude named jeremy day she died that's probably how the shirt really got ripped
catherine; 29; i'm up for a shower and tucking my daughter in i thought we solved this case what'd you get
warrick; 29; football wide screen
grissom; 30; i looked deeper into the evidence i should have looked deeper into ben's character
nick; 30; misunderstood the priest how benjamincorey jennings nonviolent crimes rogerjennings armed robbery past convictions breaking and entering assault with great bodily harm paroled 9 27 2000 this guy is hard core he's looking at his third strike here
nick; 31; you know how we pushed him to file on ben
sara; 31; what's going on yeah
grissom; 32; tell me about your brother we know that you only buried the bodies so what happened did he threaten you ben
grissom; 33; you did it directly after work using a 380 pistol and then strangled one of the victims with his own tie did you witness this
rogerjennings; 33; who the hell are you guys get out of my kitchen hey what is this nope do n't know what you're talking about my little brother got me this job i'm staying clean ben wouldn t do that ben did it he told me about it
sgt._o'riley; 33; you sound like the kind of guy it wouldn t be a big jump to murder your first stop the avcon gas station see these two guys suppose i told you your brother said did these guys
benjaminjennings; 34; look what i did just lost my head what am i supposed to do now roger you've got to help me
roger; 34; i'm on a short line all right you're on your own ben you know i can t what am i going to do huh it's your mess
roger; 35; i do n't know
sgt._o'riley; 35; what started the beef with victims
benjaminjennings; 36; hey hey man i was here first you want to wait your turn
grissom; 39; the perpetrator's hands left flour on victim face this is not from a gunshot this was something a little more intimate
grissom; 40; when a person changes his mode of murder from pistol to ligature it's for one two reasons entertainment or necessity which was it for you the flour said you did
roger; 40; neither i told you ben strangled that guy i do n't know what you're talking about
nick; 41; nope you can go ahead and take off i think we got it
sara; 41; anything on the list besides tie hey guys
nick; 42; sara could be red sauce i'm just trying to put our mistake good use
sara; 42; whoa hey dry cleaning the trailer's low rent dry cleaning's expensive this man's not as smart he thinks dry cleaning bakes in blood stains oh now you're cautious okay you check the perimeter and i'll see if we have blood stains or red sauce
sara; 43; hemoglobin take a look at this nick hey nick
nick; 44; looks like it jammed huh
grissom; 45; possibly
sara; 45; is the printer out of ink nd try again this could be victim blood try again
grissom; 46; so he altered the barrel somehow unfortunately we've had this discussion before
nick; 46; any idea what he used we present this to the'd a the guilty brother's going to walk
sara; 46; my evidence is no better total loss
grissom; 47; the bullet jammed in feed didn t it
rogerjennings; 47; he's never been in any real trouble before they'll go easy on him
grissom; 48; so it was necessity
brass; 50; well maybe this will help the travel agency contract you and shelley signed under allergic reactions to foods for shelleydanvers shellfish and then we have this from the hotel computer for your room 7 01 p m on day a taste sea lovely tureen of mild bisque with pureed bits maine lobster two bowls she didn t know what was eating when it arrived did miss kolas you're under arrest
catherine; 50; but the stroke covered up an underlying medical catastrophe she went into anaphylactic shock coroner says some of the indicators are same as a strokerenal failure cerebral edema because she didn t order it you did we've got a machine known as the esda which can read pen imprints well the machine isolated this jeremy drinks 10 00 shelley made that date that's her handwriting were you in the room when jeremy call well her allergy kicked in the sauna under worst possible conditions trachea larynx tongue swelled
tinakolas; 50; wait are you saying shelley didn t die in the sauna like what shell was always healthy i do n't understand i answered the phone he asked for her i didn t mean to kill her i thought that she would just have an allergic reaction and wouldn t be able to make her date night you know like get hives or something i didn t even like the guy i just i didn t want to be left out
warrick; 50; she died of heat stroke we missed it until captain brass brought your room service records to our attention as her best friend you would know that you killed her over a guy two met at bar her pressure got so low blood quit running through organs they shut down
grissom; 51; about
sara; 51; hey d a s looking for you what you think i read your messages top secret and urgent it's a gift reading upside down guess we know what she was calling about
grissom; 52; there isn t one piece of evidence that says kid was even present at the murders well how convenient the older brother brings it in explaining why his epithelials are all over murder weapon he set up his brother he's a good kid robin he hero worships his brother but's a good kid
robin_childs; 52; as a matter of fact that is why i was hunting you jennings brought it in about an hour ago chain of custody i can t touch it the first victim was ligatured right jennings says his little brother asked him to hide the tie a jury doesn t understand epi whatevers okay they understand a twisty tie and blood all over ben's car seat oh come on grissom they're both part of it and if i can get one them will yeah then his epithelials shouldn t be on that tie
benjaminjennings; 53; i do n't know what i do n't know i swear do n't know i he i just picked up the bodies at his place
grissom; 53; explain how bits of your skin got on the ligature used to strangle that victim your brother brought this in to the district attorney unless you can tell us how your epithelials got on that tie
sgt._o'riley; 53; he's framing you
benjaminjennings; 54; yeah man i'm there all the way
rogerjennings; 54; grab that guy's tie little bro i like that thing bury them deep all right you get into any trouble do n't have to say anything all right i'm counting on you man go get out of here go on
benjaminjennings; 55; cause he's my brother he told he told me that if i didn t talk to you guys and then this would all just blow over it'd go away i don t i do n't think can that kind of time
grissom; 55; do you have any physical evidence linking your brother to the murders anything
sgt._o'riley; 55; i got to ask you how does somebody bury two bodies as a favor you're looking at two counts of murder special circumstances the best you can hope for is life without parole
grissom; 56; i know that we've arrested the wrong brother
father_powell; 57; i tried to help without breaking my vows after the sin some call it a vocation someday we won t need jails i celebrate mass every thursday night 7 00 you do n't believe even if they're handed down by god fanaticism not religion you still suffer like a catholic light bulb goes out other people fix it get a new one light bulb goes out for the catholic he stands in dark says what did i do wrong
grissom; 57; he came to see you as soon ben was in custody we both have jobs that begin after the crime some people would call that a career in futility a hundred years ago we didn t have the technology for fingerprints fifteen years ago we didn t have dna hopefully one day we'll have foolproof means by which to put the right man in jail this case thank you but no in religion i believe in god science sunday supper i do n't believe in rules that tell me how should live how many crusades were fought in the name of god how many people died because of someone's religion semantics they're still dead i'm sorry about ben father that guilt's not in me anymore
catherine; 58; you're going to be getting a call from the local papers about spa safety we had a victim die of an allergic reaction at the mediterranean some foul play negligence that it was an isolated incident in no way should be a mark against the strip's other fine hotel casinos bottom line
grissom; 58; spa safety so what am i supposed to say csi supports lasvegas
grissom; 59; oh no how did this happen
