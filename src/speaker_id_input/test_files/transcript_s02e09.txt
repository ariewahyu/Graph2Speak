brass; 6; mr duncan take a deep breath and tell us what happened anything else okay thanks a lot and check in with triage before you leave well that was helpful quick escape
grissom; 6; actually it was gives us a starting point the falling chandelier distracts guards makes them easy targets the armed robbers load up head for exits chaos moving in one direction the money other
maxduncan; 6; i do n't know what the hell's going on with world everything's crazy i risk my life just coming into work makes you miss the mob days huh back then this never would've happened and if it did those scumbags they'd be dead every last one of them we would never know about we'd just made a money transfer to the rolling cages then bang the chandelier comes crashing down sounded like an explosion so i dropped to my knees took cover yeah i started praying for the gunfire to stop

nick; 14; did you get a good look at it make model car peel out smells like burnt wood no no transmission fluid but it's brown not red
grissom; 15; extraction is an art albert caliber the guards were armed with nine millimeters and they n't hollow point so he was shot in the back by one of his own partners
robbins; 15; i like to think so so this is our cross-dresser in thee i.d'd as adambrower shot in the back with a hollow point close range mushroomed upon impact maximizing trauma forty-five someone did n't want to share

sara; 16; wow a fumette did you get that out of some museum if you were in a hurry how would get back there exactly what i'm thinking shoe prints suspect entered shoots the clerk through potato then hops up and over leaving behind shoe prints grabs cash flips sign from open to closed exits what are you thinking
grissom; 17; you want to see me this is the video surveillance from that heist this camera was trained on their entrance all the disguises in world and they dress like women well blue's the decedent i.d'd as adambrower so enlarge red that must be the one killed brower 45 in the back at close range photoshop black dressed as a woman among men women now see that's a disguise
warrick; 17; yeah ski masks are played out red and blue teamed up together took out the guards their rolling cage black shot down that chandelier no amount of makeup in the world could cover up that chunk adam's apple no honor among thieves no stubble adam's apple
catherine; 18; fluorescent powders protocol's black assistant coroners is four hours late and we are stuck out here until he transports the body and i have n't heard from grissom i should've never been sent to this remote scene in the first place i've got seniority i deserve no've earned the right to pick my cases if i start eating will shut up since when do you care about your appearance sorry we ca n't touch it

nick; 20; you're a surfer now we're 300 miles from the nearest beach i got your page where's my report yeah thanks type f with dexron so you should be reading car and driver instead of sand surf someone put the wrong type of fluid transmission see ford automobiles use a thick red type-f transmission fluid general motors uses a thinner yellow fluid with dexron now when dexron's put into a ford it thins that type-f fluid friction builds gears grind the second gear is usually first to go friction causes the engine to overheat in turn cooking transmission fluid turning it brown leak on the pavement is first clue you've got a problem not just ford the getaway vehicle has a stubborn second gear
brass; 21; before mr brower dressed up as a woman and heisted casino he was janitor at an office park off flamingo before that he was out of town fours years for grand larceny i got a warrant whoo tidy little camper is n't he what are we looking for dirty laundry okay let's see well while you're at it do n't forget his wigs and bras
warrick; 21; well the manager's not in i got a key yeah anything that links brower to his co-conspirators i'm thinking trace elements in the clothes could tell us where he was before heist i'm going to take it all back the lab
catherine; 22; anything on the shoe print well at least we're not chasing a kid we id'd on from the open/closed sign no not so great state trooper yep well i'll just beef him to his captain tammyfelton a fugitive and clinical psychopath that grissom i put behind bars she tried to play but i did n't bite her biological parents posted bail and then she bailed on them tammy was kidnapped as a child raised by her kidnapper when she found out the truth killed him hey finish running the prints tammy uses people she was n't alone
sara; 22; skechers adult size five female how's the prints coming great you got to be kidding me officer moron contaminated the scene what have you got who's tammyfelton biological parents
catherine; 23; grissom you do n't read memos do you remember tammyfelton she's back she's been to calnevari
grissom; 23; if you're going to badger me about your crime scene location put it in a memo i always remember the ones that get away
catherine; 24; just get to the point greg wait a second there was potato on the bullet there was potato on the bullet because inside barrel of gun right one of your armed robbers may have used a potato as silencer prior to the heist maybe
greg; 24; grissom i need you asap please so ballistics sent me a bullet from the casino it's a 45 so we know came from one of the ladies guns no but there was a foreign substance adhered to it not exactly tomato to-mah-to potato you bet strange huh
grissom; 24; and this is a special bullet and the substance is special this bullet is from my investigation tammyfelton three armed robbers
catherine; 25; he ran with tammy's father mostly from the law a regular bonnie and clyde just what vegas needs
grissom; 25; so tammy kills dad and she darinhanson run off together
sara; 25; cath got another match from the convenience store the print on outside doorknob belongs to an ex-con darinhanson you know this guy too
bobbydawson; 26; yeah projectile on the left 45 hollow point courtesy of adambrower's back on the right
catherine; 26; same gun two crimes one case
grissom; 26; let me see bobby bullets confirm the story told by potato three suspects adambrower deceased tammyfelton darinhanson still at large
catherine; 27; what makes you think it's the right car
nick; 27; hey guys i just got a call from brass we got a possible getaway vehicle off i-93 it's beige abandoned 77 mercury cougar mercury's a division of ford i'll drive
brass; 28; a trucker called it in
catherine; 28; let's go
grissom; 28; well if that's the getaway car there would have been a secondary vehicle parked nearby shall we
nick; 28; yeah check for treads jim
brass; 29; all these bushes would provide good cover yeah skid mark one tire where's the other one
grissom; 29; no damage
nick; 29; if you were stashing a car where would hide it oh check out that dirt displacement there is n't one dirt to pavement then the trail goes cold
catherine; 30; it was dumped detail pop the trunk thanks it's tammy
grissom; 30; this car was barely moving
catherine; 31; hey doc she did n't put up a fight she was killed by the one person in life trusted darinhanson stared her in the face and she never saw it coming i'll run them against darinhanson's dna how did they sound they finally know where she is
robbins; 31; contusions on the anterior neck streaking erythema on the lateral aspect of zone one cartilaginous tracheal rings are crushed catherine how'd you know put his thumbs around her air pipe and pushed i swabbed her neck affirmative for epithelials parents called they're on their way in to i.d oddly relieved
nick; 32; i'm not pulling it
warrick; 32; i found similar dust on adambrower's dirty clothes check it out
greg; 33; real-life fairy dust s-i o-2 silica dust
nick; 33; yeah it turns grown men into criminals
warrick; 33; what's the composition
greg; 34; what do n't you know
grissom; 34; i thought you guys were processing the car it's used to make glass it's mined in open pits why there's an abandoned silica mine outside calnevari
nick; 34; silica found both on adambrower's clothing and the getaway vehicle
warrick; 34; yeah um what do you know about silica
grissom; 35; come here get your guns out say hello to darinhanson and we're out of suspects
nick; 35; motorcycle tracks at the vehicle dump site yeah that smells nice adamtammy now darin all dead
warrick; 35; should n't smell at all if this place is abandoned shot with a 45 execution style
catherine; 36; we found darin and tammy's prints at the convenience store hours before the heist gets murdered which explains why he killed tammy epithelials on her neck are a match to darin's dna why kill a man for few hundred bucks when you're about to steal thousand
grissom; 36; three armed robbers hold up the casino tammy's in black adam was the one blue and that leaves us darin the surveillance video tells us that darin was only one in position to shoot adam and we still do n't know why darin tammy took out the convenience store clerk
nick; 36; shot with the same gun used to kill adam at casino why did darin kill adam that's confirmed so darin thought he was getting the whole score
sara; 36; greed fewer slices bigger pieces but now he's dead so who killed him and where's the money
catherine; 37; play it again let me guess laughlin cottage casino i'll meet him at the station call you with an update
grissom; 37; well done warrick you found our mole i'll call brass he can make the arrest
nick; 37; maybe tower club surveillance missed something yeah before tammy drew her gun
sara; 37; what are we looking for he ducked before the chandelier fell
warrick; 37; i just got off the phone with laughlin csi assigned to last month's cottage casino case he told me the casino's cameras captured four assailants not three actually it did n't we did tower casino surveillance the screen on your left camera's trained over where tammydarin and adam entered the screen on your right is trained gaming tables okay check it out what you missed him all right i'll play it again slower just for you now keep your eye trained on the pit boss and chandelier yeah pit boss name is maxduncan started working there about three weeks ago before that
brass; 38; maxduncan i'll tell you how this works ask the questions give answers downtown
catherine; 38; you going somewhere good idea
maxduncan; 38; yeah what the hell is going on here what's it to you i'm calling my lawyer
brass; 39; max are you clairvoyant okay let's try this why were you leaving town trying to beat a murder rap that's a lot when someone is killed during the commission of a felony all conspirators are liable tell me who else was involved who killed darin then we got no deal officer you know what
catherine; 39; surveillance tape from the tower club casino you ducked before there was a reason to cover you forget about darinhanson your car was covered with gray dust- silica it places you at the murder scene and it still does n't explain why you went to see darin darinhanson shot adambrower but you might as well have pulled the trigger
maxduncan; 39; excuse me i saw a gun hit the ground no i did n't kill anyone well i did n't kill him i went there but no i want to clear this up all right i went out to the mine but did n't kill darin he was already dead all right look i i'll admit helped him out i i told him when and where to hit that's why i ducked but that's it well i went to collect my share but the money was gone darin was dead and i panicked but did n't shoot him you ca n't get me for murder on this look darin was the only one that i spoke to i never even met the other three
brass; 40; i kind of believe him so the last man standing killed darin
catherine; 40; yeah me too he confirmed a fourth darin plus three just like laughlin and he's still out there flush with cash a 45 caliber
grissom; 41; yeah all murdered except all we got is a gun in drag the clerk from convenience store but the pit boss said it was darin plus three well maybe he did n't know that the clerk was there he was n't counting wigs he was hiding under a blackjack table
sara; 41; i.d the unknown good chance we solve both cases laughlin and vegas that's dustinbale whoa hold on he was killed hours before the tower club heist in on laughlin out vegas so darin took him out first they cleared the register just to make it look like a robbery because he knew there were four at the laughlin heist and we're back to who killed darinhanson
bobbydawson; 42; yeah another round from the casino heist well tip did n't blossom not a hollow point so it's from darinhanson gun all right 230 grains gives us a 45 automatic okay normally lands and grooves are highly delineated these are smooth polished which means that your projectile was fired from a polygonal barrel be right back these are the only types of 45 automatics with polygonal barrels so the gun that fired your bullet was either a heckler and koch usp or glock well that's what i'm doing dissecting your bullet hey nick count the stripes six lands angroves with a right-hand twist glock's got eight heckler and koch six you got your gun pretty unique weapon expensive not exactly what you'd buy out of the back a van only take a second see can i call it only 18 registered in-state ten in clark county seven of them still circulation
catherine; 42; bobby d we need your help what else narrow it further just one it's out of left field about 75 miles out
nick; 42; indirectly yeah no it's from his head mm-hmm one two three four five six mm-hmm let's run atf any names jumping off the page
brass; 43; and absconding with a quarter of mill stolen money how does a cop hook up with an ex-con like darin
catherine; 43; where did you stash the cash i can answer that it's all in a day work a potato silencer muffles bullet but wo n't silence it you went in your gun drawn
officer_spencer; 43; you're accusing me of murder i'm a state trooper
catherine; 45; but something happened did n't it my bet tammy made you an offer
officer_spencer; 46; drop the weapon
catherine; 47; they offered you a finder's fee
officer_spencer; 48; this is n't going to do it
brass; 49; where is the cash yeah well you're still not that guy get him out of here
catherine; 49; you patrol on 97.5 square miles is the calnevari mine a part of your jurisdiction that's right we make the big bucks
grissom; 49; but you've been there have n't jim hit the overhead will you silica is a crystal it reflects the light even trace amounts will show up huh how about that was it worth
officer_spencer; 49; what are you doing no i'm east of the mine more than i'd make in a lifetime you would n't understand look i was never that guy you know that guy wins the jackpots gets promoted catches breaks it was right there
catherine; 50; 250,000 turned a career cop bad we all do
grissom; 50; yeah well he had his price
